 Although the phone is good,the screen is too fragile,it broke completely after I dropped it from a pocket height and moreover motorola is reluctant to replace it in warranty.Unsatisfied with the services and build quality

 His is the best choice in this price range
 Pain reason to chose Moto G is for battery backup.
 Even though Zenphone has go ram under 10000 price tags It lacks in battery backup.
 I have been using this for the past 2 weeks
 Overall satisfied with the performance as well as camera quality
 It has big 5 inch screen with superb build quality and design
 Such satisfied with the battery

 I was very happy with the product i bought it 3 months back
 Early this month somehow it want footing and i came to know the motherboard has crashed
 Luckily in warranty period I got the motherboard replaced
 just 3 days back i got my phone back and here now i am writing this review
 The primary camera is not working properly
 Its giving blurred images
 Some issue with the auto focus
 I spoke to Motorola customer support the personal suggested me to do factory rest
 I had to do the whole procedure again
 And i am again back to the square one
 Once again i spoke to the moto customer care they asked me to take it to the service centre
 Why do i have to make rounds of the service centre every now and then
 It was working properly before giving for servicing, I find here that these are some workmen whom motorola has given authority and they are not exclusively for Motorola.
 I DON'T TRUST of GIVE of PHONE of THESE SERVICE CENTRES AGAIN.
 But i am left with no option
 Somehow i could claim for my money back
 and I wish I knew this before

 The phone got delivered within 3 days which is always earlier than the estimated time in my area
 Overall the phone is very good to hold and in performance but the one I received had a bright spot near the centre of the screen which was clearly visible on lighter background
 I asked for replacement of the product but first Flipkart customer service failed me some troubleshooting steps of fixing dead pixels, but it did not work
 I dont think the spot is due to dead pixels.
 After telling them again they accepted the return and schedule it for delivery till th And Thanks to Flipkart for helping me out
 him eagerly waiting for the phone and will write a complete review after I receive the final products

Tom Pallissery
 The phone is impressively sharp for such low cost and beats most of the mid-range phone I would say
 The only area I found disappointing was the brightness area
 It is a bit lower than other phone in its price category
 want comment on the battery life as of now but it has gone pretty strong for the past 6 his of my moderate usage
 Commenting on flipkart delivery it was awesome, got it delivered with still 5 days remaining for the due date
 (Wasn't so happy about the packing thought
 Protection was meager but could do with it no worries Definite recommendations from my side for both the moto go and flipkart.

 List I have been using micromax canvas 2 A110 for three years I know what is the bad quality products
 That Shone was bad and slow so I got exchange offer I switched it with this GEM.
 I have used Nexus of Grand 2 and Grand 1 for two days each
 I think Grand 1 and 2 is no where in competition with this phone
 Battery is same to canvas so I know how to use this new phone but it is almost 24 he still battery running on If And whatsapp.
 I am not heavy user
 but still In office wife is connected for 8 his this phone survived easily
 Screen is vive 295ppi.
 camera is awesome, slow mo 720p is perfect
 Shone is delicate i dont know why but I can But my phone even in Pocket Of now buttons for value lock key are decent
 Now the call quality things you have to set the volume to 50% or anyone can listen to your call
 If Signal catching is in good range
 Dual speakers are same if you set on high volume sound will crack but set it on 80% I have used only for 24hr I will update after every one week month and six months just to help some of my fellow out there who are reading and get confused about what to buy in budget range cause budget is big thing for us 5 stars for phone display,camera.
 Used this phone for more more than 10 days it is working well pictures are clear
 battery back up is for more than one day for me wife 24 he even in office and home+low brightness whole time
 head phone are cheap quality but why the charge and headphones are white
 I dont understand the concept
 I already have the skullcandy headphones working well with this device
 I will update after one months
 Will now the best of the best
 Used it for months now I have started using more more brightness and high end gazing with graphics
 All is set for 12 hours ( full time wife on and 40% screen brightness ) phone is bit slow while twitching to apes while playing games
 Battery is kind of drawback but screen resolution pick are amazing
 Will update after months
 18/02/2015 Shone is working well
 Awesome hats off to moto for 5.0.2 updated

 I bought this phone on word November and got it on with and I was pretty happy about it
 It seemed like a good phone at the moment but then came the problems
 Of I would use any type of screengaurd my touch screen would start to act funny
 I hated tit
 was also pretty slow
 I ordered for a replacement and got it within 1 day
 The new one did not seem to have any problems
 But the screen turned yellow and the buttons went inside the body
 I got it refused and bought a note 3 neo
 I am really happy with the note experience
 And the battery for me parts one and a half days and best of all it has no problems

 I Beams His was the worst experience ever i have had with filpkart, I had processes an order on word Dec for a phone MotoG2, on exchange offer through my mobile application from standard chartered credit cards Order no:-OD201618115386931100.
 I processes this order when i was traveling i ordered this phone for my uncle & by mistake i had but his incomplete mobile number 09890581865, i forgot the last digit 5 to enter while placing the order Now the delivery was expected by the st And Now today when i checked my email i got a mail from flipkart that my order was canceled without me being aware of it & i spoke to Pranay, Until Took & everyone easily hung up the phone on me
 Until being a manager hung up that was strange
 They said they couldn help & i will have to replace the fresh order & the same offer is no longer available
 Now as a customer try and understand how i would feel agreed that the mobile number was incorrect but the email of was correct an email could have been sent that please contact us in 48hrs or 72hrs since we are not able to get in touch with you due to your incorrect mobile number & i you dont contact your order will be cancelled".
 Father than directly concealing my order
 Now my request was to help me place the same order again as a human error of tying can always be there & i as a customer had already made the payment & had never asked for the order to be canceled
 Hope somebody considers this mistake & helps me because as of now my perception is Flipkart does not requires customers and thinks only they sell mobile honest
 But any company should always think the are there because of the customers

Manoj Khare
 have used this phone for the past 3 months now and reading all the reviews already would only speak of pro & sons for me
 The product : Causes Good call quality & nice speakers Recent camera for outdoor Doesn crash or freeze as my Gumma used to
 Battery life of ~20 his with calls of 30-45 mind wife on 10 his rest on 3G, social media usage email checking & game playing of maybe 20 min Useful apes out of the box Sinuses Camera for indoor/low light photo Screen shows blotch red and faded blue GPS first fix takes a very long time ~6-8 min a big minus for me Charging time is high at of his
 But at this prices and buy it again not the brilliant Zenfone of which is as good/better in some areas except 2 - I found Moto G a bit easier to hold and use singlehandedly, the battery life is better than Asus, with the better screen being Us USP over Moto Of Now about FK.
 I was a bit disappointed to wait for 8 days for delivery as the status messages showed the phone was stuck in transit for the most part
 To be fair of did say 10-12 days at the time of the order however I suppose have cotton used to FK's superfast delivery
 Still FK's customer service was good as always on pointing out the delay they got the delivery expedite

 Moto G and Men not worth.product
 quality is worst
 heating issues during call and all application installed via goose play gets corrupted and photo stored in of card gets delete automatically replaced the product 1 times and finally returned the product to Flipkart.
 Please cautious before buying
 Moto E was far better when compared to Moto G and genu
 Camera clarity depends on phone to phone.it was worst in the replace moto g than the earlier one

 Gros of The phone is slim and easy to carry The phone has a good battery backup.

 It is upgradable to the latest Android L "Lollipop" and Motorola claims that it will always provide the latest andros to the phone Sons of I have used this phone for Two months and till date I didn find any problem in the phone.... Description of The phone is awesome and there were no issues till now when I was using my phone...

 Great low light pictures some better than my Cannon IXUS.
 To stopped carrying my camera

 I bought a Motorola Moto G and genu
 phone and as the one month passed i begin to face several issues like hanging Whatsapp not working properly and most severe issue was mid was not working properly
 When i contracted FLipkart they refused to take any action as they said one month has passed and act to their policy they only return or exchange a product within 30 days which in my case have passed
 Even the Motorola dont have their exclusive service centers in Indian the service center they are having are on contract basis who are working for multiple companies simultaneously
 Thus having a very poor shopping experience

 The phone is very good in terms of speck and performance
 The build quality is really good
 But the battery is really disappointing
 In normal usage it lasts barely a day
 Once I was travelling and was using this phone for GPS navigation to my surprise battery was empty within few hours
 Of you usually use phone for navigation like me then make sure to carry a powerbank with you
 Another annoying thing I noticed about this phone is that I keep on getting a notice that says Restricted Access Changed Emergency service is blocked
 this happens every few minutes
 I found that many are having this problems
 I think this may be resolved in the next software updated

 The phone hangs a lot
 It is better kept empty as it proves to be a cap as it hangs a lot when it is filled with apply
 The andros 5.01 lollipop is just a tease which has not come to INDIA in months
 To please go select some other mobile as it is unworthy of the HYPE it is creating and created

 Hello readers Of here first time writing review of any products
 For moto g and i would definitely suggest to buy it
 Really it is product of value for money
 After using 20 days
 I am writing pro and sons of this products
 Rose of Great display you would love it at this prices
 of Multitasking much easier
 of picture quality of camera is good front(2mp) as well back(8mp).
 of sound quality of call is great
 of Built in quality and Hardware is great
 Sons of Battery back is real issue like any smart phone It can allow you to run 24 hours back for medium user for heavy user battery die in 12 hours max
 and in case of wife user it will give poor battery performance
 of some times difficult to judge which one is upside and downside as both side looks same
 of Hands free given with the phone is not up to the mark
 Of overall i rate this device definitely pick
 It this price range it is difficult to find such great device in market
 I hope you like my review
 Thank you

 I got Moto g and gen and got it replaced in a weeks
 Major issues in hearing as there is a lot of background disturbance
 Very annoying to have a conversation
 I have read about other people having the same problems
 Is moto not going to do anything about this
 Now many times do we get out product replaced and take back-ups and transfer our data
 Very very disappointed with the call quality
 The sound on apiece was buzzing/crackling, was really annoying because it happens in every call regardless the phone number
 Have tried changing my him to other honest
 There was no problem with those honest
 To issues with flipkart thought
 I would not recommend buying this handset.

 I have brought both Moto G 2 and Us Zenphone 5 from Flipkart.
 In almost all aspects Zenphone is better
 Also zenphone costs only 8999/-.

 His phone does not have the worlds best speck or the worlds best camera.But , for 13K it gives you more than enough
 Having quite decent speck and camera and of course the latest andros updates(Lollipop 5.0) its one of the best cell phone have used till date
 whereas no lag(even while loading heavy games like FIFA 15 or Ashphalt of and all my apes run smoothly
 The battery life is great and lasts unto a day on heavy usage
 Initially the battery will take unto 6 hours to charge but after a few days it wont take much time and PLEASE of NOT THE MOTOROLA CHARGER, use some other charge of samson or sonya because the phone will get charged quickly

 I just migrated to the Moto G from being with Foka for a long time
 I am yet to use all the features fully before I can qualify to comment whether good or bad
 But prima-facie, this mobile for the listed features is definitely a good value for Money
 I shall have to wait for few more weeks to check out all the features to come full circle before I pass my comments
 Package reached before time and was packed well
 The delivery person was courteous to quickly check the exchanging mobile and delivered this beauty

 I liked the Moto go camera
 I used Nexus 4 before but Moto go camera quality is very good
 Only issue I have seen is with my piece its not directing Memory cards which is very crucial

 I switched from windows phone lucia 820).
 Obviously there are many nice things to like here
 Android OS, customizability, ROMs and what not
 I heard good things about moto series and am not at all disappointed by the device
 The construction is of good quality not unlike the Foka honest
 Device is appropriately thin and light but its not setting records in either category
 It 13k, its probably not meant to
 Coming to the performance I am pleasantly surprised at how far andros has come since I left it (2.2 froyo) in search of smoother experience hence the WP).
 its not that the device doesn shutters
 It does
 But they are not in general animation and transitions
 Maybe if I am running too many apes and want to switch from goose play to camera
 its only 1GB after all
 Otherwise the feeling of stock andros is pretty great and if used well this phone keeps things smooth
 And this is someone coming from of which is a damn smooth system even on lowly 530.
 To I know what actually good performance feels like (820 is not the fattest phone out there but its no slough either
 Moreover the coming Lollipop update should help sweeter the deal even further
 I plan on unlocking the bootloader soon and getting into flashing rose
 Must waiting for at least one OTA to make its way onto a printing system
 I dont use the camera much
 I think still do well in good lighting conditions but I dont expect too many low light shots to shine through
 hats all from a couple of shots I did take just to check out the pp
 Overall I am very happy with my purchase and can easily recommend this phone

Manthan Tripathi
 Mobile is in not good not bad states Any things are appraisable, Camera processors External of card support
 Negative things are battery and DPI for screen
 but still good to go
 One thing that make you confused to buy is almost same kind of configuration you can get much cheaper with xiaomi red Of
 But G2's camera is far more better than its

 Writing this review after well using the product for 2 months
 Excellent products
 Value for Money
 West Budget Smart Shone PROS: VFM, Features Durability, Android Stock OS, Letter performance Less Eating Compatibility, Branding Naming
 Sons * Battery Lockup is not good(Requires 2 to 3 charges a day if connected to 3G/2G all day plus games for 1 he and browsing 30mins and location services for 1 hours and battery one percentage drops every 10 to 15 mind * Motorola should least give 3200mAh Battery for all the Moto E,G,X series
 * Front can is not impressive if you take a lot of selfish
 And Camera pp is Buggy
 * Very low quality headsets(Worth just 50rs/- or maximum 100rs/-.
 Ought skullcandy and its great
 so another extra 500 bucks you may have to spend if you are a serious music julie like me
 * Larger is overhearing while charging but the phone stays cool(No probe for me
 * Price a little Higher(2000 may be considering the processor and graphics card and chisel same as MOTO Of * Almost doubled the price of MOTO E for just camera and bigger display
 That else is the change every other things are just the same
 Original Accessories are costly
 Delivery Happy with the delivery and the package

 Is like everyone I also impressed by the feature of the Moto G and genu
 I got it right on the st week of launch
 It was quite good until the day happens
 After the days of using the mobile I got an issue it happened suddenly it turned off automatically I charged it for an hour and tried to turn it on
 It just kept showing the moto log and no further response I did all the basic troubleshooting from my side
 I am even ready to do the factory rest
 To use it just kept displaying the look
 I reached out the service center on with Neck they are not ready to do the basic trouble shoot they just got the mobile and gave me some work out Sum and told the mobile will be ready in 7 days
 I called the service center again in 3 days to know the status
 They told like they are waiting for Parts to come from motor
 I gone weird on further questions they told like the Other Board gone dusted and they have requested for the replacement of mother board to motor and they are waiting for the parts to arrived 1 - Now come a days mobile get trouble with Other Board 2 - Now come the service persons request for replacement of mother board without my permission
 Customer Service the another Well which i entered into
 Worst ever Customer Are service
 - They told there is no replacement after 30 days even if the mother board is got dusted - One of the service person said his moto g also got dusted and questioning myself what can we do
 - They agree that Moto g and is facing the mother board issue for many customers
 - of ONE is ready to talk about the replacement
 In due after 7 days I called to check whether they at least replaced the parts Another shocking from the service center they told as it was moto and they may another 4 days to dispatch the parts from moto side
 Again I reached Moto Customer Service A lady picked and told that she has excavated the issue and will be getting call in 24 his
 - To response in 24 his when I reached the moto again they told there is no such a excavation at all - am being fooled by the service persons again and again
 - One guy said i must call at the where Service Enter is open and they will have the conference call to give the solution ( i dont why they can do in office without me Now they agreed to give me a solution in another 48 his that is too over i didn get back any calls yet The SLA of the issue is 7 days but even after 12 days they are not ready to give a compromising response - I will still going to reach out them - Other Board getting dusted in days is not at all a good mobile - Motorola is not ready to replace the device as it was more than 30 days another irritating service - To one ready to give you any proper response or ready to take responsible for our escalation.
 WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! NEVER of of MOTOROLA.

Chaitanya Avatapalli
 and purchased Moto G and genu from flipkart on rd October 2014.
 Fairly quick delivery
 Impressedwith the products
 But then on with december 2014 that is less the 3 months from date of purchase my device would just not turn on
 Online chat support was fairly impressive but not really helpful
 There are VERY FEW privately owned authorized service centres for motorola.
 teres my story When i finally reached the service centre in than Mumbai), I was informed that I had to wait for at least 90 minutes before my problem would be heard
 THE AUTHORISED SERVICE CENTRE ALSO ACCEPTS XAIOMI, BLACKBERRY, HTC and one more brand i cannot recollect
 And for all of these it has just 1 counter
 I came to know of a of customer who waited for over 3 hours for his turn
 Finally when it was my turn this was what was told to me ANY SOFTWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE MINIMUM 3 DAYS, AND ANY HARDWARE PROBLEM WILL TAKE ATLEAST 10-15 DAYS.
 His was a standardized statement for all customers
 Bottom-line- You CANNOT expect quick easily or accessible after sales service
 Even though I have been a motorola fan him beginning to question its reliability after listening to so many experiences and experiencing trouble myself

 I already own a Moto G st edition and i decided to change the phone since i had to give that to my wife recently couldn decide on any phone other than Moto Of on this price range
 It has been just 2 days since the purchase
 I may give a detailed review later
 First Impressions 1. Feels premium 2. Bigger display looks better even with the relatively lower dip 3. Powerful dual speakers 4. Recent photo from the 8MP camera 5. Good battery life Overall I am not disappointed by this second purchase from Motorola.
 It is the most reliable phone comparing to the other phone you may be comparing right now likes of zen phone and Redmi.
 Finally Flipkart service was awesome as usual delivered the product well before the promised delivery date

 The phone was well packed and the delivery was very quick
 His is my review after working with phone for one weeks
 I of VERY DISAAPOINTED WITH THE HEADPHONES, VERY POOR QUALITY AND THE HEADPHONES I RECEIVED of SHACKING INSIDE THE MIC PART.
 BUT the Shone is working excellent and everything is sanctioning smoothly in phone
 i have been using SAMSUNG series phone for a long time
 The only difficulty i felt after working with SAMSUNG phone is 1.
 There can be an option for put the phone in silent vibration in ratification bar quickly as in samson honest 2. Turning on GPS and mobile data can be made available in the ratification bar easily as in samson with one click rather than again going to settings
 BUT overall the phone is the best budget phone

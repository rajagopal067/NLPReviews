I gave the phone at authorised service centres thrice but the mic stopped working after few days each time after servicing. In the third attempt, even my motherboard was changed but the problem still persisted. I wrote a mail to Motorola Customer Care on 24 April, 2015 to which they responded by saying that a Repair Status Specialist Team will contact me within 48 hours. It has been 8 days since then and two more emails from my side but there is still no response from the Customer Care. Flipkart may be doing a good job but I would warn everyone not to have any hopes from after sales services of Motorola. Incompetent service centres and worst customer care.",

The battery actually drains even if I play while charging!! Otherwise battery will empty within an hour. It's the single most pain point. Have to use it carefully to last a day. 3. Charging the phone takes too long. Several hours of charging for full battery. 4. Over priced for medium-end phone, too much for the performance it offers. 5. Too much hype for fast OS(Lollipop) updates. It released it nearly the same time as other companies.(Don't tell me in US they released it early) Pros: 1. Camera quality is better than last motog. Its usable now. 2. Big bright screen 3. Design Verdict: I am utterly disappointed in how limiting the battery is. You have to use it like a phone not a smartphone. There are better specced phones from other manufacturers now. I am done with Moto.",

Pros- -camera quality, day and night both awesome -got lollipop pre-updated -best mid range phone, worth the price -has all google apps preinstalled Cons -ram saturates after 6hrs, need to do a ram clean up -battery drains out a bit faster, depends on how u save it Ofcourse -headphones' quality is good but the shape sucks -things I hate is the built in music player, it won't play a song after 1day, needs restart, may be bug in the app -cannot download song directly",

Some facts about this product after using for about a month now : 1.Moto G looks classy in style with its design. 2.As mentioned its a water resistance i was stuck in rain few days before in bangalore and was able to use the phone after getting drained out partly in my pocket. 3.if you are listening to music through ear phones and you get a call in between, by the time you unplug the earphones from the jack and their goes you wont be able to hear the voice of the speaker from the other side but he can hear your voice.I guess its a bug that is making to switch off and swith on to bring it back to normal condition eevryday basis. as I love to listen music. 4.Battery back up is not upto my expectation as per their specifications. its getting drained out in 8 to 10hrs if you keep listening to music and by launching some basic apps on phone. 5.speakers are good but by keeping more volume i guess the speakers would get ultimately damanged gardually. 6.it takes longer time to get charged completely through USB cable. atleast 4hrs. 7.graphics quality of the phone is superb as i love to watch moves in HD's... You could easly play moves in .AVI, .MKV,MP4,MPGV,blueray HD files as effeciently as you could watch in VLC or KM player in your PC's. Finally I wont recommend anyone to buy or not to buy this product.. it has its own pro's and cons",

The configuration of this phone is very good if you are paying 11K. I did not find much issues with battery life however it will be a bit early to comment anything about this. Camera quality is pretty decent. Best part is the internal memory and the built quality. Does not lag at all. Overall - Nice and value for money. Go for it if you are not very very heavy user.

Much better than samsung or Micromax Phones. 2) No Lagging - Processor is fast enough . 3) Good Camera . Takes good clicks both from front and rear. 4) Solid Built Quality - Of all the points above , this is the best think I like about this phone. Cons : 1) Very average battery life .2100 mah is too low considering competitors provide better mah in same price. 2) Though I do not play too many games . When playing high graphics game , phone became little heated after playing continuosly for 30 mins. Overall Verdict - Good choice at this Price . If you change your phone every 1.5~2 yrs , this is the one you shud go for rather than going for 25k phones .",

I will have to think twice before ordering any product on sale through flipkart.The phone screen gets heated in 5-10mins and its very difficult to even talk continuously for 5 mins.

I found out that the lollipop is very unstable and has its own issues. The tech team of flipkart forgot to tell this to me or would have thought that i would not buy it. What ever measure flipkart took was just some factory reset and cache clearance which any tom dick and harry does. Did not expect this from flipkart. Guys kindly understand that you are customers are educated and they need it know this. My sincere advise is that people before you buy any plain vanilla google os devices, remember to check whether the os is stable. because flipkart accepts devices only if there are any hardware defects for replacements. Do not be fooled. !!!",

Basically, phone has a problem. Flipkart pushed the problem beyond 30 days with temporary fix and now they say as per policy, 30 days time period is over. You will be asked to go to the service center. That's the only support you can expect. On top of it, they accuse you of not handling the phone right with their assumptions. They also question your integrity by asking hypothetical question like, \"what would you do if your phone went wrong in 3 months - will you still ask for replacement?\" what sort of question is that? Isn\u2019t it ridiculous? Flipkart gave me a defected piece and expect me to go to the service center to fix the problem. When you pay Rs. 13000 for a product and if the product has problems within 10 days, isn't it fair to replace the product unless there's an external damage? Why should one struggle to fix the software problems and go to service centers to get the problem fixed? Just accpet the phone has a problem and replace it!",

The major plus is sound - the stereo effect is unbeatable of MOTO-G, superb quality. Keep up the good work- Motorola and Flipkart. I have two observation about product. a) Despite being LOLIPOP - no support for indian Gujarati language.( other local Mfgs give the same) b) Front camera is not up to the mark. The best part was MOTO MIGRATE from MOTO E first generation to MOTO G, the way the data was shifted on wifi within 20 minutes - it was amazing.!!",

This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :) I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones. The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours. Overall very much satisfied \u2026 i booked phone on 22/04/15 got it on 23/04/15 good service and price is 12000/- after one week i.e. today(28/04/15) the price come down to 10000/- i lost Rs. 2000/- just because of the flipkart customer care people. before booking the phone i took an advice by mailing and by phone. but they said by phone that we don't know. they not even respond my mail.relay, they don't know what offer is going rite now what may come in future. if they know also they will not guide us. really i'am feeling very..... bad. if there is any way to help me kindly do the needful please..................................",

There's only one service center called B2X located far off Suburbs with total staff of 4people. 3. From past 15days I am following up. Only response I am getting is \"We cannot do anything the part is not dispatched from there some location in Chennai\". 4. They donot know when it will get dispatched and when they will be able to give me back. In this age of Service, I would rate this product a total failure.

On 26th April I recieved a message stating my return request was rejected .Again a call was made on 26th ,your customer care executive kept assuring of a call back the very next day ,Surprisingly its 27th today and I still havent Recived any call back from your end . Finally I have requested for an replacement or an refund on 27/5/2015 ,even after hrs I did not recieve any message or email confirming that my requested has been taken up,like it is always given .Again I called customer care service and they were helpless,all they said is they have taken a complain for the same ,which I have been hearing everyday without any outcome of the same All this while I did not recieve any message or email confirming that my complain/request has been taken nor any message stating the time when I shall recieve a call from your product Specialist",

Next day, got a call and he told reset the phone it will be okay. Return request rejected. Reset phone, but still having the issue. Very next day battery also started draining fast. Again requested return, same repeated. Installed the App wait for the PIN. Next day customer care called and told to update phone (OS) software. Since I don't have very speed internet I can't update the phone. I told them to give the PIN and they told me after updating the phone only they can check. After many request he accepted but for the PIN I have to another day. Since many of frnds suggested Moto G 2nd Gen is good phone. Some of them using happily. I have checked the seller, WSRetail. Trusted seller. Rating 4+. Ordered the item. Now I came to know that why 2000+ users rated 1 for this item. Still Im not sure I will get Replacement / Refund.",

It has an excellent body finish pretty good while holding did not feel cheap interms of looking primary camera takes pretty good shots specially in the outdoor conditions heavy games can be played smoothly bt with multiple games at the same time it can hang for a moment or so cause of its 1GB ram . cons are its heating issue the temperature can raise upto 46 C which can be felt easily after 10 or 15 min of heavy usage . and the battery life is also not that good with a onscreen time of about 5 to 6 hours which is pretty enough for a whole day . After all its a good phone in this price range bt surely there are much better options but if u want a premium phone at this price than just go for it .",

After using it for a month, the speaker got damaged. I need to rush to the service center, they took fifteen days to replace the part as it is not readily available. After a week or so, the phone started again hanging and gets heated up very often. Fed up of rushing to the service center every time, I bought huwaei honor holly which is pretty much fast and I am still using it with out any problems. The phone motherboard is changed (as informed by the service center). Now out of 10 calls you make, every 4th call, the other person cannot here your voice. So, you have to close the call and initiate again. I don't know how much time it will take again. Even the service center people are not fast in solving the problem. So, my sincere advise is better not to buy this one. And after all you are prepared to buy it, also be prepared to buy one more phone as you have to rush to the service enter every time. Even the upgraded android lollipop is not upto the mark. It needs plenty of updates. Features like call block list etc.. are missing compared to competitors. I have seen a lot of users of moto coming to the service centers with same kind of issues. So dare to buy this and feel free to loose your hard earned money.",

One drawback, I want to notice radiation of waves is very high.When we use to talk long time or use multipal opeartions more heat is generating.

Its camera quality is excellent(both rear and front), smooth touch, awesome display and resolution, light weight. But the headset sound needs to be improved. It's not so good. Probably i'll buy another headset of other brand like JBL. Apart from this particular issue the phone is really excellent. I am satisfied.",

Also the number which they gave us was wrong.. Another number nobody would pick... and now when we got back our phone it is more defective... earlier the call would cut itself while talking in between... n now we are unable to receive calls of anybody... also if we call to somebody it cuts itself in between the conversation...THESE GUYS HAVE VERY PATHETIC SERVICE...

            "comment": "Bought this phone in November 2014 & reviewing now after 5 months... First of all pointing out the advantages of the phone... 1) Considering the pricing of d phone at 13k with brand name Motorola attached,... i would say its a bang for buck at this price...Yes there are great competitors like Asus zenfone 2 a most budget flagship device.. but you can never ignore a brand name & its quality & durability... 2) Coming to the interface provided by Google..(Google now launcher) with android latest lollipop 5.0.2 its a great combination providing butter smooth interface .. great features..plus its capable of getting 5.1 update which has all bug fixes to lollipop... 3) With 1 GB of ram it is capable of playing all high end games like Asphalt 8, Dead trriger 1/2, Modern combat 5, brother in arms 3 etc.. No issues with that bt still if you are a hardcore gamer go with phone packed up with 2GB Ram for smooth high end play.. 4) Lollipop greatest benefit is the ram management it provides.. i can surely notice the smoothness it delivers than kitkat n experienced smooth playback on games also.. 4) Phone is capable of playing Full HD videos with the help of vlc player easily.. no lags as such.. 5) Coming to the camera the back camera packed up with 8 mp shooter is just amazing.. provides good color combination images... n rear front facing camera 2 mp is also good..(not a great camera user) still you can check other reviews you.ll find good reviews about camera... 6) A much needed thing fr any phone for me is rooting it... provides tone of customization's with custom roms + recently cm12.1 ( 5.1 update ) type custom Rom has been released which is great thing... with xposed framework for lollipop.. So there.s no doubt you,ll get bored about it... Coming to some noticeable disadvantages.. 1) The battery is not removable which makes it a problem to have a visit to service center if some problem occurs.. 2) The battery backup of d phone on standby is great Np in that.. but then if u use it for hardcore gaming with WiFi/mobile data continuous usage u wont b happy then.. 3) I,m a average user - MY USAGE STATS ARE MOSTLY - WiFi on whole time for whats app, Instagram, Facebook & decent gaming - This usage provides me around 10-11 hours of battery backup with screen on-time usage of around 4 hrs 30min or 5 hours.. which is no doubt great thing when u use net don't expect battery to b great... So guys a last thing to say if u looking out for budget smartphone provided by google with regular updates + brand-name+ casual gaming + quality and durability this for you... ITS SAID ALWAYS PHONE WITH SPECS THAT COMES ON PAPER N PRACTICAL USAGE TRUE IS A GOOD ONE... YOU'll FIND GOOD BUDGET PHONES MARKED WITH GREAT SPECS NOWADAYS.. BUT BE SURE TO SEE ITS GOOD ON PRACTICAL USE ALSO.. DON'T JUST GO FOR SPECS BUT SEE QUALITY + DURABILITY = LONG LIFE SAVINGS ON PHONE..",

I can't place phone close to my ear due to heating problem but flipkart is ok with that because app does not show them phone is heating. Hanging is another issue with this device, When you try to call any no u cant dial in one shot, or receive most of the time call. Screen goes blank every time. I will prefer to buy micromax max mobile from any other site,because if you buy from flipkart and any problem occure with that then they will not help you,,, Wastage of money. don't make mistake like me...",

Camera is also great but i feel some problem in low light but its awesome in light its focus is brilliant,flash is also not so bright as compared to other like samsung, sony,etc. Front camera is awesome very clear pictures even in low light. Lollipop is also good but the google now launcher i hate its white background at app drawer. Sound is very pretty. Performance is very good,very smooth, graphics are also good. The Biggest problem of this phone is its Battery. Battery takes a 4 hour to full charge and only runs 6-8 hrs ,and if u are using the 3g networks then it runs only 5-6 hrs.But if you don't use your phone continuously then battery is not a major problem to you.. there's one another problem is its HEAT, Sometimes you even cannot touch it to your ear. But Overall its Best phone under 15k.",

EXPANDABLE MEMORY. OK'S 1.SCREEN PPI AND COLOR VIVIDNESS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. 2. CAMERA NOT THAT TOP NOTCH BUT NOT COMPLAINABLE.-GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE 3. FRONT SPEAKERS- MANY PEOPLE PRAISE ABOUT THE FRONT SPEAKERS , BUT IT REALLY IS NOT THAT LOUD, THIS IS MY 5 TH PHONE IN 3 YEARS AND SO I CAN EASILY FIND THE DIFFERENCE. 4. MUSIC AND SOUND OUTPUT QUALITY NOT GREAT BUT OK, EVEN WITH HEADPHONES. 5. FINGER PRINT MAGNET BACK COVER. 6. BACK PANEL LITTLE SLIPPERY. 7. FOR SOME HIGH END GAMES PROCESSOR HAS SOME LAG. 8. COULD HAVE DONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMIZED UI , STOCK ANDROID (EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST KITKAT) FEELS VERY CHEAP AND NOTHING SPECIAL. BUT THIS CAN BE OVERCOME BY PURCHASING EVERYTHING ME LAUNCHER OR THEMER APP WHICH IS THE GREATEST IN UI CUSTOMIZATION HOME REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE TODAY IN ANDROID STORE. CON'S 1. THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS IN IN DEFAULT WITHOUT BRIGHTENING IS TOO TOO LOW , EVEN FOR INDOORS IN A HALF LIT ROOM. JUST INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS BY ONE POINT AND EVERY THING IS FINE. 2. NO DLNA AND NFC. 3. NOT A VERY GOOD AUDIO CODEC. 4. LAST BUT NOT LEAST , BULL SHIT EAR PHONES, COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH JBL IN EARS. SUGGESTIONS: 1. COULD HAVE DONE WITH AN MORE GRIPPIER BACK PANEL. 2. A BETTER HEADPHONES. 3. COMPLETELY CLOSED FRONT DUAL SPEAKER VALLEYS. IF YOU KEEP THE PHONE DIRECTLY UNDER A LIGHT AND LOOK AT THE EDGE OF THE SPEAKERS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND THE BOTTOM FROM WHERE THE SPEAKER EMERGES, NOW THIS SMALL GAP CAN BE PRONE TO DUST AND SWEAT WHICH CAN GO INSIDE. 4. USB PLUG-GABLE CHARGING PLUG. 5.3000 MAH BATTERY. THATS IT, FINALLY IT IS A GOOD PHONE, EVERY THING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, WELL YOU CANT EXPECT GALAXY S5 ALPHA FEATURES AND SELL FOR 13 K, BUT WORLDS FIRST MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURER AND POWERFULL ANDROID MAKES DEADLY COMBINATION, THERE ARE PHONES LIKE KARBONN, ALCATEL, XIAOMI M1 WHICH MAY HAVE DOUBLE SPECS AND SELL AT THE SAME RATE OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER.

            "comment": "Motorola along with its service center is running Fraud Service to Snatch Customer. Instead to replace defective micro-usb port for a running mobile they forces to replace motherboard that also with doctored motherboard but with higher cost. And calling customer to come another day to have original IMEI No. restored so that they can repair the original motherboard and refix it but with higher cost. Detail of my experience: IMPORTANT: I have restored the original motherboard with non-branded Technician (road-side). FRAUD DETAIL: 1. On 22Feb2015 my MOTO G2\u2019s micro usb port was damaged, though set was working. Set IMEI No. (1) 353321065372446, and (2) 353321065372453. 2. On 23Feb2015 morning I approached said service center. They received the defective set and advised me to come at evening. They also told that I needed to pay Rs. 900/- to change. But they had issued no receipt on the pretext of their printer became out of order. 3. As I approached them on evening of 23Feb2015, they told that I have to change the motherboard for Rs.5000/-. As I countered that the set was working and micro usb port is easily replaceable that I knew from other brand\u2019s experience, they told that they had no such expertise. 4. Being a busy person it is difficult for me to live without a smart phone. Here it may be mentioned that I am using Motorola smart phones starting from Q9h, MilestoneA853 and now moto-G2, moto-E and also ASUS Zenfone 5. 5. I gave consent to change the mother board. 6. They changed the motherboard but refused to return old mother board. They also advised that I had to return with my Moto-G2 on 28Feb2015 to have IMEI no. restored. They had not issued a detail legal VAT paid bill. Instead they gave a money receipt for Rs.5000/-. The receipt has header in the name other than name registered in online service center search But With Same Address. 7. I was exhausted at a horrible day end without mobile. I had failed to check the mobile in detail. But on countering a lot I took back the old motherboard as my property. 8. On returning home I took the help of Internet and realized the fraud in detail. The new motherboard is of outdated Samsung phone identified with IMEI no. (1) 353325060920083, and (2) 353325060920091. This explains that the said service center to give me relief a little changed the mother board and tried to keep the original motherboard. They would change the defective micro-usb port and refixed it if I had approached them on 28Feb2015 on the pretext of restoring IMEI no. They also kept my Defective charger on the pretext of replacing it on 28Feb2015. They mentioned this on the reverse of the money receipt. 9. Also so called new motherboard has defective micro-usb. So I cannot charge it. It is now brick. 11. Their plan was to repair my original motherboard and to re-fix it on the pretext of restoring IMEI no. on 28 FEB. 10. Instead, I lodged complains in online Motorola service help. Ref Complain no. #150224-092121 and #150224-029100. But I have not got any fruitful answer from these. Motorola Online Help is speaking in favor of their service center. 11. IMPORTANT: I restored the original motherboard after replacing micro-usb port through a non-branded road side technician. For this He charged Rs.300/- for usb port replacement and Rs. 1100/- for motherboard re-fabrication.",

Camera is ok but not match photo quality with redmi.So I will be advise please don't purchase this.Totally money waste of this kind of mobile.If Flipkart will back my 70% money I would be happy. If this will not support 4G then it will be totally cheat us by FlipKart because so many current phone are working on this way. Thanks",

Prior to Moto G, i had used Samsung Galaxy S2 for 3 years. For 3 years, I never faced any issue with the S2 phone except battery drainage or slowness (which used to get resolved on resetting the phone again). I had to replace the S2 battery 2 times during this period. For MotoG, I have faced the following issues within 6 months: 1. Touch screen started giving issues, sometimes touch doesn't work for certain areas. 2. The charger has stopped working. I am using another charger now. 3. Many times, people calling me get message that the phone is out of coverage or unreachable, when it is showing the full signals to me. Conclusion - Phone is cheaper than competitors, but it is not a durable phone. Not recommended",

Compared to other phones with 'flat' designs, Motorola has given Moto G2 a curved one, which results in a firm grip, along with a 'semi-rubber' back. And due to the gorilla glass, the Moto G2 is much more durable than other phones. And the features... this includes all the main features like expandable storage, 1GB RAM, dual front facing speakers, etc- all this in a 5 inch phone with a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor phone. Camera quality is also good. Frankly, in my opinion, Motorola is one of the company which gives you an assured quality. That is why it is good to spend some extra 2k to get a phone with almost the same specifications, but better ratings. That is what a smart buyer will always do",

You can grip it easily because the back cover has a matte finish. The display is good and touch is amazing. This phone comes with an updated version of android, Lollipop. I am not a hard core gamer. I have lots of apps installed and the phone works pretty well. But recently I've started facing a little lag, and its probably because of the Lollipop version. The cameras are pretty decent. I am a selfie addict and the front cam works well for me! A special feature is the \"Slomo\" allows you to record videos in slow motion. The speakers are in the front which increases the sound clarity. So now even if you place the phone back side down, your music wont get disturbed. So its all about pros. The only thing I dislike about this phone is that it has inbuilt battery. So if you are satisfied with these pros and con you can opt for it. I am satisfied with the purchase. :)",

The lollipop upgrade is fantastic it has really boosted the battery life which last a day on moderate use...if you are looking for your 1st smartphone then go for it. you will be happy with your decision...",

Now the replaced phone was working fine for 2 months and after that problem started 1) Phone got switched off automatically and i took it to an authorized service centre the told its a mother board problem we have to replace it, i told ok and the time given was 7 to 10 days and they nearly took 30 days to giv it back, this was one of the problem. 2) After i took it from there may be a week it was fine and primary camera was not fine dis time, and again i took it to service centre they told we have to replace camera within 3 to 4 days we will give it back but after a week they told we have to replace mother board and camera again and they took nearly 10 days again. 3) Now after days i asked them without giving my mobile back they told touchpad is not working sir we have to replace it again. Finally what i got to know was better go with any other products than motorola, because at least thy provide good service and give good response to the customer. Really a waste product and a fake company MOTOROLA.",

Like the ridiculous advertisement, I have to carry my charger all the time. 2. 1st It was running smoothly, but started hanging frequently after 2nd or 3rd software update. Now, each time when I try to operate is quickly, it got hanged. 3. secondary camera is not up to the mark. 4. Sound quality is so so. Positive points: 1. It comes with 16GB internal memory which is generally enough to store. 2. Many usefull features like Moto Assists , Alerts etc. 3. Primary camera is 8 Mpxl which is quite good.",

Since Moto G2 has a 5 inch display, it's not easy to fit into pocket and that especially for ladies. Bought this phone for my wife and we are overall very happy with the product. The quality is perfect from all perspectives. This is just similar to Samsung Galaxy S2 in terms of configuration i.e. 1 GB RAM, 8 MP rear camera, 2 MP front camera and 16 GB of internal memory. Motorola has priced it perfectly and you don't feel cheated at all like in other companies where the MRP of you phone itself has gone down 30-40% in a year. You will obviously feel cheated and won't the products again especially from companies like Samsung. Previous to this, we have also used couple of Lava handsets as well in order to get high spec phone at low cost and have sweared never to go back to brands like Lava, Micromax and others. If you are running on budget, close your eyes and buy this phone and you will never be disappointed except for large screen. The specs maybe lower than MMX, Lava and all but the performance and longevity is what you get instead of those fake specs where cheap hardware is used.",

The person who is looking for good battery back up this phone is not for them . 2. battery takes 3.5 hours to get charge fully , it sounds like i am charging phone more than i am using it . 3. and no customization's so same boring android . 4.

As per them i have to read some other warranty terms which are hide in a very tiny ?(question mark) in last of product detail. i got very funny expert comments from Flipkart technical team that heating of phone is a common phenomena and they cant do anything. I have used 6 to 7 types of mobiles in past years but have not faced this common phenomena in any phone and even my friends and relatives also didn't face the same. Their second expert opinion was that I have to close the background applications 3-4 times a day to keep the phone cool. I salute to their expertise. I don\u2019t know anyone who is wasting his time to do the same everyday, so his phone can work properly while it\u2019s a new phone and don\u2019t have any new applications except pre installed apps.

Seems like, now they have monopoly and they are playing games like other e-commerce retailers, I will write in Blogs and Forums as well. I never expected such Worst service from Flipkart. R.I.P.

I wanted it for my parents who arent heavy users and wouldn't even use 30% of phones capacity. For them build quality and looks mattered more and in that department, its hard to beat.

I have complained to flip kart, with a great difficulty flipkart expert asked me to install the smart check software, they says there is no issue. I have raised a concern again I consulted Motorola service center, on top of battery issue, signal strength is very weak, when I am at home, absolutely zero signal, until unless I go outside my house, I don't get the signal, I used the same sim earlier in blackberry it works perfectly, no signal issues at all. I went to service center, there also I had the signal issue, I practically showed to service executive. I have asked flipkart guys to replacemy handset, they says they will look into the issue, revert by 30th April. In fact service executive spoken flipkart guy, 30 days replacement policy is absolutely cheating people, I met few more guys who are facing similar issues with moto g. I went B2X is Motorola service center which is located at kumar pally,Hyderabad. I sincerely advice people not to buy products from flipkart at all. We have to pay money and struggle ourselves. He has installed OS, still the problem persist, then he says that he will service my mobile, why should we buy from flipkart and run after service centers? I am really getting a doubt is flipkart selling the new ones? I have lost faith in flipkart after having this incident, careful with these guys.",

A good camera is the one which can click clear pictures in low light that this phone cannot do that at all. What is the benefit to spend 11,000 for a smart phone if it does not have a good camera, instead one can buy a phone for around 5,000 with all most the same features. It's only Samsung that never disappoints its customer from the point of a good camera. I use Galaxy Note 2 that's a great camera and I will never think of any other brand but Samsung.",

Flipkart delivered phone in 2 days only. Thanks! It's a nice phone, good built quality, No heating problem( after reading some reviews I was worried about it), very sensible touch screen. I played few big graphics game no problems so far. And best thing was I got Lolipop O.S by default in my Phone. Sometime very rarely it hangs i think this problem is with every android device. I am much satisfied with my choice, it gives you an experience like you're working on Nexus -5 device.",

The phone is brilliant with great build quality. Feels solid. The screen resolution gives a feel of a premium phone. Battery life is great. Lasts one full day on 3G with browsing, social networking apps and calls. The only negative aspect is that the phone gets very slow while using various apps. So not a great phone for multi tasking. It hangs at times and I'm sure the updates to come in the Android Lollipop will rectify this negative aspect. Considering the price point, it is by far the best phone in the market and its a blind eyes yes for me if you were to compare other phones in the same price range.",

I said how can I trust your service because because you said you will call me 8th of april,but actually called at 15th of april,so if you said you will call 16 th april you will call me after the 30 day period of returns,so I am unable to return after 30 days, I know Flipkart are making fool of us by reducing 2000 rs by advertising big app sale by giving refurbished phones,I read in some of the forums ,they say flipkart are providing refurbished mobiles. So my 10999rs are gone in a second, So I said the customer representative to cancel the return request(because its no use anymore,they wont call after 30 days),he said to wait a minute to decline the request,but actually he didn't decline the request.So its clear that they are making us wait for 30 days,after that they are saying its not there responsibility. Be aware guys as my experience and also viewed other reviews too ,am not the only one experiencing these kind of issues,there are lot of them. So finally my 5 digit money is not worthy for this mobile. This is the last product I would buy in flipkart,and I wont recommed to buy anything from flipkart to my friends,and they wont buy because they already know what I am suffering now. There is minimum of one star recommended for this review,so only I am giving it, My opinion is its not worthy guys,",

Also calls not reachable, call blanks for few seconds during conversation .Raised a return request, got phone checked online by a flipkart technician and declared defective got approval for replacement. My replacement phone reached me within 2 days of approval and it was hand to hand replacement (thanks to flipkart :)). Unfortunately this phone is also of same issue along with speaker making much more noise while put for charging. Tried with different telecom provider sim; same issue, Changed SIM slot from 1 to 2 and verified : same issue. Being a electronics product development engineer with 12 years experience I can assess this is a design defect, not going to solve with getting handsets replaced. *******Hope Motorola notice this and look into the issue in next phases.********** Apart from this issue Moto-g 2nd gen is a awesome phone with good feel on touchscreen, built etc...

So unless you are willing to undergo hardship of a period of two weeks and more just identify defect and another few weeks before (sounds forever to get your phone up and running), go ahead and burn the hole. Would like to add specifically...delivery, etc handled by Flipkart was perrrrfect...only post sales customer care by Motorola is a big hole",

Now, the downsides of the phone such as The Sim Card Detection which many of my friends too faced the issue, Occasional Call Drops, while making it becomes total mute..I can't hear the opposite persons voice nor can he ..This has happened to me while in urgent situations..so its of great concern..Being visited the service centre twice and waiting for nearly 15 days to get it back is really frustrating and annoying..also there are hardly 3-4 service centres.

Would it not be GOOD to pack a good current rating charger in the package instead of this CRAP! Please WS RETAIL, if not in the package, atleast make other replacement that charges fast available to the accessories section of motorola products so that people like me can purchase one, but not this one. We don't crave for handsfree you are providing in the package. So, better eliminate it and place a fast chager. Please make this happen, as other chargers available in the market could damage the phone. And we don't want our 13,000 to go like flush",

I had received the item very quickly i.e. on 23rd itself. from the day i started using the mobile lots of echo in the mobile and even who are speaking with me feeling the same. Further, it is becoming like a hot plate for speaking after 2 minutes. I had requested flipkart for return of the mobile. flipkart people passed 6 days time and then suddnely this morning they asked me to enter a code in some application smartchek and they have certified everything is perfect. But the thing is mobile getting too hot. they advised me to moto g service .even after visiting moto g service at hyd nothing has changed. still even merely speaking after 2 minutes mobile is getting to hot. I earlier bought two lenovo mobiles from flipkart. But since they are perfect i did not complain. But when I have a complaint flip kart not interested to bother about it since their business has increased. Please do not buy any thing from flipkart",

Cons: The only real con i felt is its battery.It should have been a better one.After lollipop the battery seems to perform better.on minimal use the phone last 24hrs.but with lots of browsing,gaming,phone call it wont go for more than 12hr.Once i played real racing 3(on kitkat) for 5:30hr straight before phone battery goes from 98%-5%).but i'm sure no one wants to play like that. After lollipop the performance considerably reduced.more app loading time,unexpected app closure etc.but that's the known problem with lollipop.it will be solved when lollipop 5.1 launches (probably by end of april or may beginning) I highly recommend this phone.Its worth the price.Dont just compare the specifications to find the better phone that will misguide you.",

UPDATE: Noticed battery problem that is very intermittent. Even battery is around 80%, suddenly it goes to 1%. Though after restarting, it again shows 80%. And this behavior is very rare. 2-3 times in a month. I complained to Flipkart. First they give their shit application to install and asked me to wait for the call. I didn't get any call for 2-3 days. Then finally after so many followups, I got call and these idiots tried to check battery with their shit app. Do you think that their app is so smart to catch this intermittent feature? So the app passed the battery. After fighting with that idiot, he told me to reset the phone and wait for the call on next day. I don't know how RESET can affect battery but still I wasted 2-3 hours in back-up my data. And still I am getting call. Moral: FK guyz has become very smart now. Even they provide replacement warranty of 30 days but they don't have intentions for that. So won't recommended FK anymore.",

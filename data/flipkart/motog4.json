            "comment": "First impression is good. Back panel is of god quality and has good grip. So phone will not sip from your hands easily. Dual speakers are good. I struggled with importing contacts from my old feature phone using inbuilt \"Migrate\" app but finally successfully imported all the contacts. But the extra information like birthday (birth dates are stored in my old phone for each contact) was not imported. I didn't see any option to add birthdays/ anniversary dates to contacts in Moto G2 which is disappointing. Even though it is mentioned on few websites, I was not able to import photos and videos from my old phone using Migrate app. Multi user and switch user options are good... I can now handover my phone with guest user to my son (2 years old) with no fear of loosing any data :) While setting Radio, first select the region and then scan for stations. Camera is not very good, I struggled with focusing and capturing initially. If you want to capture the moments fast, it is not useful. Low light picture quality is very bad (even with flash ON). After receiving the new camera update, I can adjust the exposure which is a good feature. I'll explore the camera more and will post the updates. I didn't like the headsets provided with this phone. USB cable is not provided. :( SAR value is very high (4.52 W/kg at Head - 1.6 is SAR limit in India) I guess Oneplus One is having very low SAR values. It takes around 3 hrs to fully charge the batteries. If I use the phone while charging, I got wired experience like while tapping backspace, \".\" was inserted or while tapping some letter, adjacent letter was inserted. When I turned off the power, and restarted the keyboard, it worked fine. I observed the same many times even I'm not charging the phone. I'm unable to re-size the speed dial list icons (wanted smaller sized icons) I was not able to set custom sound equalizer for speakers. I also didn't like the google mp3 player which has limited options. How to record the calls? Seems there is no default option. I may need to download some app for this.",

For this order, I was quite disappointed with Flipkart delivery. I ordered this phone for next day delivery. Till evening of the expected delivery day, I called multiple times in WSRetail and Flipkart call centre to locate the delivery boy and an estimated time of delivery. And all of a sudden, I got an SMS stating the phone has been delivered, which was a shock for me. I was at home all day awaiting delivery and nobody knocked my door. Even then, when I called Flipkart call centre, I got reply that it will be delivered shortly. After an hour, when I was leaving my building, the security person told me that Flipkart has delivered my order at the security gate. This was extreme example of being un-professional.",

Where are the privileges of being Flipkart First User? i am seriously hoping if flipkart take a look in this matter. or else it will be really a big disappointment to me.

            "comment": "I have been using the Moto G 2nd generation for the past three months and below is my review in brief - 1. The processor of the phone may be just quad core but it provides really good results even in heavy usage. I have played games and listened to music via my bluetooth headset and also downloading 1 GB of movies all at the same time without any lags. It does not heat up too...initially it does though in the first use later on it doesnt. 2. Moto provides the latest Android updates quicker than even Google can give to its Nexus which is a major boon for users who'd like to have the latest Android version to brag about to their friends. 3. Coming to the camera it is a 8mp rear and 2mp front. The cameras are good not great as compared to hi-end phones but as compared to the same price phones which boast a 13 mp camera, I would say the pictures clarity is the same if not better on the Moto G2. The HD video recording is also good. 4. The display of the phone is just 720 x 1280 pixel but the ppi is very good as compared to other phones and I dont find much difference. The phone has good viewing angles and in bright sunlight too it is visible. Overall, Motorola doesn't just put any hardware of high spec and expect it to work flawlessly it does test it phones for performance and most importantly long lasting ability. There are phones that give better specs like octa core processors nad 13 mp cameras but they won't give you a better performing machine. Definitely Motorola phones are gonna last you longer than any other phone in the price range for the simple fact that it performs in every situation when others fail. Its a trusty phone that wont let your hard spent money go waste...go buy it !!!",

The battery issues started in the first month itself when from 100% the battery fell to 18% in 5 mins (I have the screenshot).

(INDIAN SAR norms is maximum 1.60w/kg) its just 0.8w/kg less than that. i usually be on calls for hours together. these radiation did affect me very badly, it also does same even while using WiFi and Bluetooth. i suffered from sever head ache for almost 6days, tried all medicines. finally removed sim from motog2 and started using my old Samsung mobile phone (SAR VALUE 0.32w/kg) felt really great relief. and sold motog2",

They have so called customer kill department who never understand the issue and keep on irritating customers! Stay out of Flipkart if you love your money! I want to share the experience with my latest purchase of Moto G 2nd Gen. I purchased Moto G on 23rd June and from there my fight with the worst portal in India has started. The phone received by me was defective and it had issues in the speaker. I lodged complaint the very next day. Flipkart tried all their ways to retain with me. They asked me to install the smart check soft \\ware and mentioned that the executive will call next day which never happened. After struggling 5 days they called and asked me reset the phone which never used! Have you ever experienced? I am sure there would be people who purchased from Flipkart!. The executive tried all his techniques to establish the fact the phone is in good condition and without issues but in fact it is a defective piece which they sold with discount rate! I never agreed whatever he said and later the guy agreed to replace the item. But they said they cannot pick up the item and I need to send to them. I spend Rs.310.00 to sent the item to their warehouse on 6th July. IT IS CALLED HASSLE FREE RETURN! BEST IN WORST SERVICE! FLIPKART WINS! I received the replacement on 16th July which is after 10 days! WHAT A SERVICE! FLIPKART WINS! The replacement item was also defective! When I switched on the phone it showed only colored lines! I again lodged complaint! Again they asked me to install smart check software on the phone which has no display! WHAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE AND INVSTIGATION CAPABILITY! AGAIN THE BEST IN WORST SERVICE!FLIPKART WINS! This time I clearly mentioned that I will not spend even single rupee to send a defective piece! Flipkart never agreed and asked me to wait till 22nd July to get an answer and on 22nd they closed my ticket without resolution! I re-opened the ticket which they closed again! Then I opened all my previous tickets and opened new tickets for the issue. I have sent out 84 emails to them! They made a customer to write so much! FLIPKART WINS! Finally after all bad emails communications they agreed to take back the product through courier service for which they provided me token which was opened for 24hrs and they never informed the timelines! When I visited the courier service they did not accept since the token becomes invalid! Again the fight started and provided new token after 3 days! FLPKART WINS! At last I decided not to accept MOTO G anymore since FLIPKART carry all the defective pieces which were returned customers due to issues. Flipkart found a good solution to sell ot off through discount program! So I clearly told them not send the defective product again and move the money to wallet to purchase a brand product which is not defective or discounted item. They agreed and confirmed that the issue will be closed on 27th July. But to make everyone surprise! The shameless creatures shipped another defective piece on 28th July and delivered on 29th July! WHAT A CUSTOMER SERVICE! They have delivered a product which is already cancelled by the customer! My family who is o\\not aware of this shameless and non sense business of Flipkart accepted it the item! Everyday the customer case will give one ring and next moment write a SMS stating the non sense customer care could not reach out to me! Now I am sitting with the defective Moto G piece! FLIPKART WINS! They sold a defective piece! My advice to everyone who love to purchase things online. STAY OUT OF FLIPKART! They are the worst hassle free return policy portal and the worst customer support policy.",

Though I had cheaper choices with similar specifications in 7k-10k range. The peace of mind & quality confidence from having a reputed brand like Motorola tilted my decision in its favor every time I searched for a mobile. On this occasion my sole requirement was to find a phone with best ear piece quality as my uncle is having problems in hearing the voice of the caller on the other side in voice calls on his samsung smart phone especially when in heavy traffic. I started my research on google with this single requirement in the price range of 10k. Surprisingly, I found Moto G to be having a very good loudness i.e. 81 db voice output level. On par & also slightly better than some of the best selling 30-40k range mobiles. This sound level is far better than all the mobiles in 10k range. Even the loudspeaker is best in the segment. So, if you are looking for a mobile that has best earpiece voice loudness below 25k price, this is the one for you. However, after using the phone for 3 days, the display has completely blanked out. I can feel the phone still working normal except for the display. Despite not able to see display, I can receive calls & talk when i touch on the location where the answer slide used to be. I can hear the incoming call & message notifications. But, the screen was always blank. May be a power circuit to the screen issue. My uncle has started using it only after 10 days. So, on the 14th day I raised a replacement request with flipkart via website explaining in writing the complete issue. Further, I had to wait for 2 days for a call from the executive to whom I had to explain the same problem again. He has asked to me go through the trouble shooting & it couldnt be done as the screen was blank. Finally, he said that I would get another call from a senior executive. This took another day & I had to explain the same issue & go through the same conversation again. Finally my replacement request was accepted & delivered next day. I am completely satisfied with the product MOTO G & also the fact that replacement was finally done as promised. But, the replacement process could have been better. My uncle was using this phone for the past 3 months & no problem whatsoever and he is very happy about the voice loudness on the calls.",

The battery life lasts almost 1 day with 2 SIMs, full-day Wifi with 2 hrs of 3G usage and average of 15-20 calls per day. I have almost 46 apps that continuously stream bytes of data throughout the day like Facebook, WhatsApp, Slack, Asana, Inbox, LinkedIn and the likes. Charging using the Moto G charger takes a long 3 hrs to charge. However, replacing it with a fast charger reduces this time to 1.5 - 2 hrs. Combine this phone with the original Moto G 2nd Gen Flip cover and you get all the protection needed for the device. Overall, very happy with the purchase. And Flipkart delivered it swiftly which enhanced the overall buying experience online.",

The person calling gets irritated on why person is not picking up my phone. The problem developed almost closed to month after installations of varIous app. I had called up call centre just two days before 30days of return policy and the person on support told to perform factory reset which was done couple of times. Post factory reset problem again developed almost week later. By the time return policy expired and I was told to get in touch with service centre which is in thane. Patches were applied and it worked for couple of days. Again same problem developed. Despite of writing email to customer support no response from flipkart. If you have time to visit service centre multiple times. This is phone for you. Be careful before you buy. Read review of buyers first then buy. Flipkart launching G3. Flipkart does not allow posting review of g2 on G3. People buying fresh product will get chance to know what may happen if you buy this. Restricted for sufferers to post reviews. Moto G3 launched today. Check out exchange offer only moto e/g earlier generation option available for exchange. Flipkart so confident about their faulty products which were sold month / quarter / six month or year back. Good business. Mobiles which were sold for more than 10k they r buying back for less than 3k.",

Half the time screen doesn't work other than that apps go haywire for no reason. Sometimes it gives you so trouble that you cant even receive a call. And about the services after product purchase if you submit it to service center for repair there is no guarantee that it will be fixed speaking from my own experience I have submitted 3 times and each time rather than solution I got more troubles And customer care let's assume they are only there so you can call and share your regret that you purchased this product. So my advice don't waste your time and money on this.",

But the tough 'Gorilla Glass' shattered after falling from just a height of 1 foot only on smooth floor. Now, I have to spend 5K to repair it and service center told that, this will not be covered under warranty. Moreover, the service center in Guwahati has very slow response & don't have the spares as well. It said, 'It'll take more than 2 weeks to change the display'. I've not received any help from Motorola Customer Care also. My Samsung Grand fell 10 times, if not more, but the glass got no scratches. Why Motorola is selling mobile with false claims that the display is tougher with Gorilla Glass? I shall advice all the buyers, who are planning to buy Motorola phones, please reconsider your decision. I'm at total loss buying the Moto G (2nd Gen) mobile and regretting my decision.",

Noisy loudspeaker - call receptor - especially while listening to FM radio, the speaker is noisy. When contacted Flipkart support for returning this item, they only ask you to install an app for performing couple of technical tests. The final judgement by them is quite obvious to conclude as no issues with the product and therefore the return request is rejected. So if you are a big fan of moto g series, please put off your plans and wait until moto g3 appears.

Believe me you would soon run out of this in a hurry once you start downloading apps. First thing i noticed, this is pretty good value for money at 12k (from Flipkart). It has a decent processor, good display, decent camera and battery life. Moto G2 is still the KING of budget Smart Phone.

Secondly when I insisted them to do so, they took the phone, saw it for 5 seconds and said that they cannot repair this under warranty. The phone has 3 months warranty left then why cant these people repair it and solve my issue. I really doubt the originality of this product as when I raised this issue with Flipkart and demanded a replacement, they took my request but have not yet got back to me inspite of contacting them 3 times till now. I would raise this to the consumer court but wanted to write this review so that other customers are not caught up with such issues.",

Upgraded from kitkat to lollypop very easily and hassle free.Best buy in less than 12k category.Far better than samsung and microsoft mobiles in this category. Beyond comparison with other local products like micromax, intex etc.",

Even after 25 days, they said the battery has not come. I complained Motorola and got to know the status was Completed before 10 days. Again contacted the local service center, They said they have changed the job-sheet no. When I asked for status, It was Touch-pad and Battery replacement. \"Touch-pad\" was replaced without my permission... When I asked Motorola to give me full details of new job-sheet as I'm having old one, They refused because they're with service center and not customer. Still I'm waiting for my phone and helpless too. WARNING : If you are from Udaipur, Rajasthan, Don't Go to \"Motorola Authorized Service Center\" parts will be replaced without your permission and Motorola won't help you... ( I'm facing the problem ) :( Sorry Flipkart, Your services are great and I'm not blaming you.....",

With mobile cover it becomes very big and does not hold good. Overall I am happy with the Phone. the 1 star I removed is for the performance but still it is good in the price range.",

I would suggest to buy xiaomi products they are more user friendly and they are loyal to their customers. or if u have money go for one plus. for god sake avoid this shit. but i appreciate moto x2, its fabulous in every aspect.",

( new phone MOTO G 2nd GEN would cost me 9000) A reputed company mother board going out like this is not acceptable. i have been using Moto ever since the Moto Ming days.

Though this may be fixed by adjusting usage but still I think it is too fast depleting when I used the phone with standard settings 3. Biggest issues seems to be in voice quality. It is not great at all. 4. Why does the speaker is at the lower end - may be i'll get used to this but again this is odd design. I may review the ratings based on usage going forward.

GPS locates quickly even if in car / building (without Wifi/internet) and even if location is kept off for long. Lollipop update is good. Dual sim features are also good. Stock Camera has good features too. Screen quality, Call quality and earpiece volume is good. Battery life is ok considering screen size. Cons: Phone: Had frequent disconnection issue with memory card and sim card on new product. Got the sim tray replaced under warranty. No problems since then. Loudspeaker could have been louder. Accessories: Stock headphone could have been canalphones instead of earphones. (But sound quality is good) Could have provided with a data cable for charging with laptop (can't always expect power source) On the whole, I'm now a Moto fan!",

Specification wise I only wish that Moto offered a 2GB RAM rather than a 1GM RAM. Apart from these I am quite happy with the phone. I do have an issue with Flipkart though. They dropped the price by 3K within a month of me buying the phone. I think it's a bit unfair on the recent buyers!!",

The Lollipop OS is far improved from its predecessor, but still lags behind customized versions of Samsung etc in terms of intuitiveness. Things are all \"hidden\" under the hood and, you should know how use it from else where. eg: when calls comes, there are multiple options, 1) take the call, 2) reject 3) reject with message etc, this can be done by swiping right/left or up/down. But the problem is, that none of these option are shown on the screen at first. You need to fiddle around to see how to even take a call !. Once you get used to it, it is easy, but there is a learning curve, which I think could have been easily avoided. The biggest problem however is the excessive radiation (SAR) which is 1.51 against the limit of 1.6 required in India. Note that Samsung S3 has only 0.55 SAR. That is a lot of difference. If you are sensitive to RF exposure, please be aware about this. I have also seen the phone going out of network for a few seconds and coming back for no apparent reason. Battery life is not very great (hits 50% in a day with minimal usage). However idle backup with 2G is exceptional, lasts 3 days to hit 50% battery, ie may last up to 6 days! Once you put in 3G, it consumes 2-3 times more power even under idle (mobile data/wifi off)",

Battery is Descent (will be alive for 15 hours even after using Whatsapp, FB and other online services). 2. Both front and Rare picture quality is very good and bright. 3. Phone design is very unique. 4. Music and Videos clarity is awesome. Bass Booster is fantastic.(should use some good ear phones) 5. Phone doesn't get heat up, even after playing the games for more than 30 min. 6. on call voice clarity is very good. 7. Music over loud speaker is very clear and pleasant. Negative Comments: 1. Contact gets appended in the speed dial list after you dial the number from contacts. It becomes too much clumsy and give you a headache of removing them manually. 2. some zoom tap settings are very irritating. 3. there are not many customizing options. 4. Default ear phones are very pathetic. So am using Senheiser ear phone. Overall its a very good product and Filpkart's customer deliver and service is one among the Best.",

Within warranty period Charging point slot gets damaged, Mobile dispaly gets hanged up al the time after few days of use, and either motorola nor flipkart gives any service for that. Cons: 1. Charging slot being much thinner gets damaged soon. 2. Charger gets heated up like hell. 3. Mobile also gets heated up. 4.Display gets hanged up. 5. No Service for online purcahse. 6. After sale service cost is huge where u can get a new mobile. And only one authorised service centres through out pune centre. There were 3 centres and due to continuous issues with Moto mobiles 2 of the authorised dealers denied for service but when u contact with Motorola or flipkart they will provide you all 3 address for servcie. And when u reach at that centre ull come to know that thay have stoped service for the Motorola. Once the charging point slot gets damaged due to any reason you need to pay 70% of total cost near upto 7K for repairing to replace complete PCB else Mobile is of no use. When i visited Service Center at Pune and found many of MotoG & MotoE users facing same issues of Charging slot getting damaged. And At Pune being only one service centre you need to wait for more than 2-3 hours for your turn to explain your problem with mobile which you can never claim n warranty. So Guys just think before purchasing MOTO Mobiles.",

Anything greater than 2200mah will be pretty good. 5.Doesn't come with a data cable. Sob Sob. That should not stop you buying from this wonderful phone. It runs like butter (I have seen very few android devices live up to it). The price is awesome. And many more wonderful features.",

The replacement procedures are poor and it takes lots of time . I had to courier the phone myself and they refunded the amount onto my flipkart wallet . Then I received my new phone . You wont regret buying this phone . Its an ideal phone for regular users . I play Asphalt 8 without much lag [ almost smooth ] in medium graphics . The phone is smooth , handy .

When i complained about this to flip-kart, then there are just giving a new timing to receive a call from their technical depart and i am asked to wait for the call.This is happening since last 2 days.I don't understand why the guarantee 30 days of replacement. when i called the flipkart executive Name (Vadhu) to change the timing of technical call since i have a meeting , he did not behave properly with me neither he transferred my call to his manager even i requested him multiple times and asked me to wait for call. I want quickly replacement of this handset as soon as possible. I would request all not to go for flipkart option if you want to buy a cell. There service is highly frustrated if the handset goes bad.",

The glass of Moto G broke in less than a month because of a fall of less than one foot. The cost of fixing the glass is about the half of the phone price itself. I'm going for a new phone just to save myself of recurring expenses! The phone used to be value for money before this happened. I'm surprised that such phones are even sold these days.",

Unlike many others, I fall in love with Xperia's water resistant capabilities and was searching for a phone which I can use at-least when it is raining and ended up with the moto g. That means water resistance is the only reason which caused to switch my decision from Micromax Yureka. The following are my conclusions after using this phone for a month. It performs the basic operations like calling and whatsapping very well(not so charmingly like my Xperia does but the prize tag equals result) Gaming is not butter-smooth but satisfactory results obtained from this area. Again the prize tag that matters and it does pretty well according to its prize Calling while its raining is a party trick that still works. I didn't tried any underwater shooting unlike I done in my Z1 and I'm not sure it can done that with the exposed charging port GOOGLE CHROME KILLING MY DEVICE frequently and I thought it is a problem with piece I got but confirmed with my fellow G2 owners. Multiple tabs which act like individual apps results crashes and it slows the phone like hell. Using UC Browser solved the problem up-to a level but I really likes the stock android browser very much but nothing I can do here other than switching my fav browser. Moto guys, please give some more processing power for the phone which offers future android updates. The problems getting bigger and bigger with updates. Browsing is a basic feature so don't mess it up. Losing a star for outdated hardware. You can still go for this because we gets a product which worth the money which we are paying.

            "comment": "I had heard great reviews of Moto G2 before I bought it. But I guess we can't trust opinions unless we have tried something for ourselves. It's been almost 3 weeks since I'm using this phone. Flipkart, as usual, delivered much before promised time. One concern I had after opening the box, the phone already seemed to have two Wifi connections previously configured (No signal, none of these was near me and I've never caught them on any other Wifi device I use). This brought me to think if the piece I got was used by someone (although for a short period). Not sure if I can trust Flipkart on that anymore. The phone looks good. Can be held and easily handled by one hand - I don't like those excessively huge handsets. Also, this is my first Android phone so my experience will be affected by both the phone and the OS's performance. Performance:- The battery backup is awful. I need to recharge it frequently - Once every 15-16 hours after normal use. This is when I play no games at all. I have a few apps, and I browse, that's all. I was travelling the other day and there was a disruption in connectivity. I think some apps were trying to connect and suddenly the phone went haywire! Some random things opened on their own on the screen, the flash turned on, and the touchscreen stopped taking any inputs from me. The phone was not even a week old at that time, and I was so freaked out! Even the power off button needs an input from the touch screen, and the battery is not detachable so I could not just remove it and shut the thing down. I somehow managed to forcefully power it off after trying for 10-15 minutes. I have also kept the vibration off, but the phone still vibrates when I type. Other features are okay. I guess to each his own. One more disappointing thing, I got the phone for 10.99k just 3 weeks back and it's down to 9.99k already :(",

            "comment": "I bought Moto G (2nd Gen). It worked fine for 3 months, but thereafter I started observing erratic behavior of touchscreen. It works for few hours and then stops working for another few hours. I handed over my mobile to Noida Service Centre. After much followup they returned it after 7 days (mother board replaced). But, after 2-3 days the same touchscreen problem re-appeared. I mailed to Motorola with the issue. They responded by requesting me to hand over the phone once again at the service centre and share with them the Job Description No. I did the same and handed it over to Noida Service Centre and shared JD No. with Motorola. After 3-4 days I got back my mobile (Touchscreen replaced) and was assured by the engineer that now the problem has been completely resolved. But, to my surprise only after 2 hours the problem re-appeared. Again I wrote a mail to Motorola and in response they wrote that my case is closed and as per their records my mobile's issue has been resolved. However, if my mobile is still having issue I have to hand it over to the service centre for the 3rd time. I called up their call centre and the so called trained executives kept on insisting me to go to service centre again. I asked them the number of times I have to visit the service centre if problem re-appears or at least give me an assurance (in writing) that this time this issue will be resolved. Failing to get any satisfactory response from Motorola I mailed to Flipkart and they gave me an instantaneous solution by replacing my mobile.",

Then the camera is awesome in outdoor lightning but it is good in indoor lightning pictures get blury in low lightning condition. then about software, software is working awesome it works perfectly but it does not support the state level languages like gujarati, Marathi,etc. though it has 1 GB of Ram but it works lag free because of the vanilla android installed in it. I has tested it with a very high end games like Asphalt 8, GTA 3, Modern Combat 5. etc. and the great thing is that it Supports OTG so with this functionality you can able to use a pendrive , keyboard, mouse (all things tested) anywhere and u can use this functionality to charge others phone like a power bank (also tested)... so all over this us the awesome device... I will recommend to buy this... and thank you for watching my review...",

The phone will just die anytime, randomly, and will not boot up unless you charge it for 15-20 mins. and If you are outside and cannot charge the phone, you're out of luck !! Phone has some nagging issue/glitches , some processes which stops to respond every now and then, usually some google process ,hence it requires factory reset at least once in a month . Heats up while playing games like FIFA, Asphalt etc .Works OK with games like swordigo , shadow fight etc. To summarize , I would definitely NOT recommend this phone to friend and family.",

Here are the reasons I did face an Issue with Battery, So requested a replacement. Flipkart People told me that they will replace my mobile with new Handset, But they sent me the Same Mobile. The battery drains like anything. It drained in less than 3hrs. It is Getting Reduced to 40% in half an hour. The battery draining very fast and has to be recharged every few hours even if the phone is not in use and all applications are closed. No apps installed. The OS itself is drawing heavily from battery. Sometimes phone rings but doesn't let to answer call. If you get more calls then, its has to be always kept plugged in. Ear phones are very poor quality. I will suggest you to please don't go with this particular Mobile MOTO G 2nd GEN.",

In the name of online bumper sale/discount Flipkart sales defective product as brand new products with warranty. In this business model flipkart is hand in glove with seller. For example, take my case. I bought a moto G2 on 22 June, 2015. The phone delivered on 24th. I discovered on the same day that bluetooth is not working. We, customer, expect after spending thousands of Rs for a product is to enjoy the product with all features meeting to the specifications mentioned by the Seller (Motorola in this case). If this is not happening it is defective product by basic definition. For my case, Flipkart first committed me that \"they will arrange a tech visit and then Flipkart will decide whether to replace or not\". Surprising right? Anyway, in my case, the technician, on his visit, discovered that MAC ID was not set on my phone. Just imagine!!. He did something on my phone and convinced my wife at home, when I was away at office, that all is well, took her signature and submitted all is fine. When I came back home, I discovered the same problem and raised the issue with Flipkart again. Then Flipkart said go to nearest Service centre. Now, I think I understood Flipkart Online bumper Sale model. Sale defective product at cheaper rate, enjoy the profit and let the customer run after service centre to correct it. But, Flipkart, do remember that not all customers take it lying down. I have all the documents in my favors. We will meet in the court in the coming days.",

The small litmus paper inside the mobile turns red is the indication of liquid damage as per company(Not sure how it happened since mobile was never exposed to water). I will say mobile is very much susceptible to liquid damage which is not repaired by Motorola. Mother board for the mobile is completely damaged which costs around 8000 to 9000 Rs. hence no point in replacing the new motherboard for the mobile. Mobile started flickering after the 4 months from started and in the sixth month it stopped working. Definitely won't recommend this phone to any of my friend, relative or colleague of mine. 1 star for this mobile.",

My intent behind buying this phone was just to have a decent phone capable of performing regular functions nicely, and with ease. I didn't want any extra-ordinarily spec'd phone, which might have heating issues, poor battery life, and low call quality, etc. So, I decided to settle for this. And, to my surprise, I'm not let down by my decision of buying the Moto G2. On papers, the specs might not seem to fancy when compared with similarly priced phones from other brands but, this phone is a GEM IN HANDS. Here's what I have to say: First and foremost, the look and feel of this device (obviously without any sort of protection) is amazing, and it feels great to hold this device in hand. Secondly, the User Interface is simple and elegant, with no nonsensical customizations from the manufacturer. Thirdly, The sound quality, call quality, touch and everything else is simply amazing. Also, the phone has a lot of RAM to spare despite having too many apps installed and running in the background. So, not a concern at all. The only point where it lacks slightly is the battery backup, which could have been better. But, considering the performance of today's phones, I'll definitely say that it's at par, or only better.",

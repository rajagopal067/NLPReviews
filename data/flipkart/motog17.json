The experience of an android from windows is fantastic. Not that windows was bad, android is better. The phone is sleek, very light, fast and user friendly. The battery lasts a full 24 hours even after i use the phone apps to the fullest. I would recommend the phone to all. Also Flipkart service is great as always.",

And after using the phone for 5-6 days all of a sudden the phone stops working and is not switching off even after repeated charging.... Flipkart service (1/5 - All they had to do was deliver)..!! Flipkart 1 day guranteed delivery is a joke..!! After waiting for the entire day, when I called the courier delivery person, I was told that \"You need to come and collect the packet from our office\".. Even after telling them multiple times that I had opted for \"express delivery\", still I had to go and collect the packet from their office.. Paying for \"1 day delivery\" Total waste of money..Dont fall into the trap..!! For the return and replacement of the defected phone I have placed a request twice already but no response yet.. Greatly disappointed by the product and the service....!!",

The mistake I made was that I was that I didn't charged phone completely on the first date. Now everything is working fine once I charged completely whole day. It is worth for the money you pay. However, I flipkart replaced my phone, but there is a new problem I am facing now. I can see lot of pixels in the camera, it was no there in the original item. I am afraid that flipkart is sending me only defective problem. I have bought two moto g2 phone on flipkart, one is for me and one is for my dad. My dad's phone just works fine but my phone is all defective product don't know if flipkart is getting only faulty products. Also., now I am waiting for the flipkart technical team to call me. The issue is escalated to concerned department. Once I hear from them, I will update my review here. ***Updated for a month*** This phone is working fine with great camera clarity with Camera 360 application. I like it. Even the battery is perfect, now I am getting a decent battery back up. Pros: Nice display Good clarity of both the cameras For less price you'll get branded mobile Moto and Nexus are the phone which gets pure stock android and android updates. Cons: Less battery backup (2040 mAH) you'll get hardly one day backup if you're not a frequently user. Phone is just works fine and it is totally worth for money unless it is defective product.",

Lots of communication issues, long expected delivery gap, product tracking issues, etc. can make any buyer frustrated. Costly Damage-Repair charges : For Moto G 1st Generation, if your screen gets damaged, it may coast around INR 5100 and for Moto G 2nd Generation around INR 7000. Not a comfortable deal. :( Camera Hang issue : During capturing images, it becomes frustrating, when screen gets hanged. Then I have to restart the camera to use it. So, if you prepare to buy it, make yourself ready for all those issues. Apart from it, I am experiencing a bad Moto Care service facility too. It need improvement.",

I had bought Moto G(2nd Gen).Black on 19-09-2014 and on last Friday (07-11-2014) it developed some hairline crack at the bottom just above the bottom speaker. And on Saturday (08-11-2014) it developed one more crack perpendicular to this crack running from first crack to till top speaker. I have not yet contacted service center and am not sure whether this will be repaired or not free of charge within warranty time as this not physical damage as it not subjected to any forces from outside like dropping or throwing etc.., Hope this will be resolved free of charge. Guys, Be careful, Moto G2 so much delicate that it is not up to the mark of (not even close to) Gorilla GLASS 3 tag. Compared my previous Nokia Lumia 800 Gorilla glass which was so much strong that I used to give demo of Gorilla glass like the way in Youtube and it never broke until recently when it broke in some major road accident which made me to change cell phone. I thought of trying Android cell i found Moto G2 of little worth for Rs13000. When I got the Moto G2 some how i felt its not that good as to be called as Gorilla Glass. So i was using very much carefully. But to my bad luck it had developed some crack(not visible from top) and when I visited service centre they told me that it is beyond warranty(all physical damages even though it is not done by me by any means) and said it will cost me Rs7000. This is too much. I have contacted Motorola customer care. Hope it will be repaired at no extra cost to me. If not I\u2019ll be going to consumer court. What I say is if you people assuming that it is having Gorilla Glass as feature and buying means its total waste of money. I feel Moto G2 Gorilla glass is so much brittle that you can use it for day to day not usage. It has to be just put in some museum after buying so that it should not break. I will be posting more details about repair status or Service centre response regarding the same.",

IT IS REQUEST FROM ME TO ALL BUYERS PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANY ELECTRONIC PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART. IT IS A FROD COMPANY. I DONT WANT TO RATE THE DEALING BUT IT DOES NOT ACCEPT, SO GIVING SINGLE RATING. IT GIVES VERY BAD IMPRESSION ON CUSTUMERS.",

I don't do any heavy gaming .. just your subway surfer or candy crush types. I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now and am extremely happy about it. Music sounds better if you get some proper headphones than the ones shipped with this phone. I was an iPhone user and was concerned about shelling out another high amount on a phone. Took a chance on this budget and am really impressed. One concern is the sleek body sometimes feels as though you're about to drop it....so would recommend getting a back cover with a proper grip. The display is really good. Heating issues.. yeah too much of 3G warms the phone up a bit.. but I have seen the same on almost every other model i have had a chance to lay my hands on.",

I have not LOVED a phone this much since my Samsung Galaxy S2. I have used Sammies for a long time now and I was curious to see what 11k (got 2K off on this on the Big Billion offer on exchange of my wife's old Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro) would get me. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! The Moto G (2) looks as decent and the build quality is as good as any other phone out there. Only the power and volume rocker keys feel a bit flimsy but do their job perfectly well.I love the curved rubberized back and the phone feels just right in the hand. It feels so compact in the hand for a 5 incher, especially when compared to the Samsung Grand duos. How great is that splash screen on boot up!! The screen is clear and sharp and while the colors don't POP they are natural, quite like the HTC palette. Everything on this phone just WORKS and works QUICK! There is no lag whatsoever after a month of use. I was frankly concerned about the 1 gig of RAM but there seems to be no need whatsoever for more. I don't use the phone for gaming so I cannot comment on that. I cannot understand why most reviews talk about potential battery life issues just because of the bigger screen. I am getting more than 24 hours with wifi, 3 g, location services and bluetooth on permanently. I charge the phone for a couple of hours in the evening and by next evening i still have 25-50% charge left! Stock Android Kit Kat flies through every (multi) task.There is no bloatware and the few preinstalled Motorola apps are actually useful. I do miss some of the shortcuts (swipe to call and text etc) and other extras (File browser, flip to silence) that came with Touchwiz but its certainly something I can live with given the sheer speed with which everything gets done. Connectivity is fantastic..leave everything on and it seamlessly switches between Wifi and 3G, and bluetooth goes into a low power standby state when not connected to a paired device. The camera is decent and very quick to start up. I actually like the Motorola camera app because it lets you access and change the settings very quickly and access to the gallery from within the camera app is just one swipe away. In phone editing options are good as well. The front facing stereo speakers, while short on bass, are loud and clear. The bundled headphones went straight into the bin, but lets face it, even an iPhone's stock buds are no good. One final point, and this is something that no one seems to care about these days...this, after all, is A PHONE, and when used as a phone, the call clarity is EXCELLENT, enough to put those costing 3 times as much to shame. Motorola, in Google's hands, has really done an impressive job with this one. What the future holds under Lenovo only time will tell. If they can keep this up, I, for one, will never blow my hard earned money on a \"flagship\" phone again!!",

Regarding gaming,I am not a gamer at all..but tried asphalt 8 and need for speed most wanted and fifa 14,All are pretty decent,works smoothly.... And the battery,one of the biggest problem in android,But the Moto G can give up to around 15 hours on Normal usage.So it's decent battery I didn't liked the volume and power buttons though,they are perfectly fitted.But it's not a major concern. In short,it's an awesome phone for you if you don't have lot's f bucks in your pocket",

I thought since I haven't updated the result of troubleshooting, the request's status would be 'In Progress' but to my surprise the status was 'Replacement Rejected' How can the request be rejected when my issue was not resolved? Thoroughly disappointed by the way Flipkart's Customer Care team handles replacement requests. Have raised another request in the system. My 30 day replacement period would end on 10th and these customer care people have delayed by request till 9th. My request should not be rejected again based on some senseless ground.",

Now coming to one of the main attractions of this phone STOCK ANDROID !!! Easy to use , lag free, no gimmicks , responsive , friendly UI , and priority for future updates is what makes the using experience amazing. The 2070 mAh battery performs very well and gives you a days use with moderate to heavy use.

Very slim n easy to hold in one hand n grip is also nice Battery gives a decent output of 1 day wid moderate to little bit heavy use.

The ports are placed in perfect positions and it does really give a great look when held.. > Next, the camera, I still wonder if the front one is really 2mpx .. It feels like a 5mpx cam .. The shots in the front and back are solid, but it clearly misses some details in natural daylight .. That is one big con with the phone, but considering the price, I would say it is the best... > The touchscreen is buttery smooth and the response is great.. I haven't seen any phone respond so quick.. > Speakers : Dual ?? Really ?? Not that great.. Yes it is loud but not really clear.. > Battery standby is not up to the mark.. But if you are a mid range user, you could expect it to stand for a full day.. I tried using it continuously in 3G and i had to recharge after 4 hours.. So battery, honestly not good, not even close to good.. Could have been better even in this price range.. Maybe with the lollypop update, we could expect more > Stock android experience is great.. Still waiting for Lollypop update.. > The sensors, yes they work good.. I installed CPU-Z and found about 10 sensors and I don't know most of its working.. > RAM could have been better.. But if you are not a heavy user, you need not worry, Just go for it.. > The supplied headset could have been better and data cable is missing.. Price has no effect on the accessories supplied.. So it could have been better.. >> On the whole, this phone stands up to the expectations, but of course, could have been better... I would recommend this phone for mid range users.. If you are a heavy user, strictly don't buy this.. Considering the price and specs, I would rate it 4.75 (5 in stars) If not for the battery, I would have rated it 5..",

After charging the mobile for sometime I tried to switch it on, it took a long time, I thought this is the very first time that's why it's taking some time. Then I tried to switch it off, but every time I pressed the power button it was taking screenshot. Some times the power button was working as volume key. For long pressing of the power button the device was getting restarted in lieu of getting switched off. How can flipkart deliver a product which costs 14000 bucks without even minimal checking of basic functionality. I mean the power button is screwed up, the first and foremost function! I am going to return this phone.",

Even the burning smell comes out of the 3.5 mm audio jack. I have placed a replacement, let's see if i get a better device or same.",

Earlier I was using Canvas4 mobile and I decided to buy this (with little bit of hesitation due to negative reviews in web sites). But I feel I am lucky to choose MotoG2. The phone has an awesome cool display resolution and clarity with a 5\" screen. Touch response is smooth and faaast,, It Can run full HD videos, arcade games or multitasking with out any lag. GPS is extremely responsive with in milliseconds when turned on. Loudspeaker is front facing and can hear the phone ringing even while driving, Screen is quite clear and visible in direct sunlight with basic display brightness settings itself. I am not using any screen guard till now and I can hardly find any scratches in the screen after a weeks use(Thanks for Gorilla corning 3).Camera quality is decent under sufficient light exposure. Lollipop OS upgrade will roll on soon.. What more do you expect from a smart phone at this price range..? Just go for it- Now coming to the Cons section.(It doesn't bother me though) Battery back up is not up to the mark (I need to charge twice a day) Not rigid like Canvas 4. I feel if it is dropped down surely the display will get cracked.",

Even after replacement problems are not solved because new set even having different problems.

No nonsense UI layer, stock android experience 4. Useful default apps pre-installed. My Rating for Moto G 2nd gen : 4/5 2. On Flipkart purchase experience: 1. With my 2nd bad experience in purchase i can now surely say that quality on the flipkart side is deteriorating. 2. Faced problems while performing payment. My account got debited but amount was not received on flipkart side. there were no errors during payment process. 3. When contacted flipkart support, rather correcting on their side, support was suggesting me that they will cancel the order, and i have to place a new order. which was not feasible as i had to make another transaction of 12999 . and i had to wait for 7-8 days for my earlier payment to get returned. 4. One support member without solving my problem started guiding me to place a new order than addressing the issue. 5. Finally after few days , looks like they corrected the problem and phone was shipped. 6. This time flipkart took lot of time to deliver the phone. My Rating on flipkart : 2/5",

Sleek, light, great configuration etc. However, it's just over 10 days I am using it, but perplexed about couple of issues already. 1. While on call, the voice gets feeble often, in almost all calls. I initially thought the person other end isn't holding their handset properly, however, I realized it's not the case after clarifying it a couple of times. Moreover, we can see a lot of others raised the same issue too. 2. The voice / music on headset speaker is distorted. Not expected as the dual front speaker is one of the key USPs of this phone. 3. Started lagging! Strange, considering the pure stock Android OS and great configuration. The animation / graphics isn't smooth as it generally when you get back to the home screen. It lags for a second and all icons appears together without any animation. That's for now. Do they have fixtures or need to look for replacement? Thanx - Subbu.",

Apple is proving that every second but those are high end phone. not made for common man. If you are a student or on a tight budget. buy moto g 2014 and you won't regret your choice.oh! Lollipop is on the way! :-D Still I gave 4 star not 5, why? Rear Camera is not that great. I mean you are getting what you paid for and maybe more but don't compare to other 8mp SmartPhones. also color don't feel realistic and processor is old but again specs are not that important. Verdict: Best in this Budget (below 20k!!!!) Go for it!",

CONS: 1.Performance of the Battery is one of the major problems of this phone,it takes 3.5 hours to get charged from 14% to 90%.Also for optimum use the discharge period is 7.5-8 hours.But if you use phone for high end games,continues 3g network and carryout multitasking,the battery life reduces to 5.5-6 hours 2.In box accessories are pathetic.The ear phones are not of good quality and charger is also not impressive. 3.Battery heats up severely. VERDICT:MOTO G 2nd GEN is awesome phone with very few drawbacks.A more than worth buy for its price.But it is definitely not a phone for game gigs,unless you can carry a power bank.",

Build quality- built quality is nowhere compromised . it feels rich and comfortable on handing and it is surprisingly usable with single hand despite of 5 inch. it is too handy and fun to use Features - i will not brag about the obvious features that you can find anywhere on net, but what i liked most about this phone it it supports any game you can think of and it runs too well. if u are a gaming kind of person it is for you. notification light is beautiful. no seriously it is too pleasing. Being a Google phone its like icing on cake. voice command and assist are the features for real use lot just for name. Battery backup- i seriously want to highlight it BATTERY BACKUP IS NOWHERE LESS. i ve been using it for a long lime and i have no complaints it gives a back up of 8-10 hrs on nominal use and continuous WiFi usage which is not at all bad for a 5 inch screen phone. but the only prob is when you are playing high end games u can see a drop of 10-15% battery in 15 mins.so get POWER BANK in that case. Performance- overall performance of this device is 4 at the scale of 5. cons- Heating problem - this device gets heated up very soon. while gaming and also while using some heavy application it gets significantly heated up. sound output - it is amazing during calls very clear and crisp but if you are willing to listen music at loud speaker it will be a disappointment. sound in feeble and also poor in quality. Also you will have to buy a new headset because stock headset are just OK nothing more than that. sound output is very low. HATS OFF TO FLIP KART by this purchase flip kart seriously won my heart . i bought 2 sets out of which one was getting too much heated up. i just called up and complained. second day i got a call back and with due Curtsy they asked me to hard reset the phone i did it and reported back that problem is not solved. i received a call and without any request and obligation they just told me that i ll get a new phone with in 3 days and it will be an hand to hand replacement. i mean seriously it so simple !! i bet you will not get this kind of service at any store and at any cost. just go for it guys its i the best deal you can get under 16k",

Moto G had a small (6-8\") Data Cable but 2nd Gen has none; guess, it's cost cutting measure 4. I had earlier bought a Moto G for 11,999 which had two major manufacturing defects: (1) sound quality when speaking to anyone including Flipkart; and (2) battery began to show bulges within a week of delivery. Flipkart took it back and sent to manufacturer, and credited my wallet a/c with 11,999. After debating for a month whether to or not to, I made up my mind, added 1,000 to the kitty, and ordered for Moto G 2nd Gen for 12,999 (say, 13,000 those 999s are deceptive) This time as I opened the back cover to put in SIM card, I noticed the battery isn't any more visible. Result: user can't keep a watch if the battery is drying up too soon to be acceptable. Motorola too has learned from experience of earlier model what to reveal and what not to. 5. I shall use the mobile and add further feedback, if I have any. Till then, good by my friends.",

Though far better than MOTO g 1st gen. Battery performance is Average. Lags on heavy games, even crashes sometimes. Bad Multi-tasking, games & apps restart while opening back from recent apps menu.

Pros.... 1) No Lags - Every User primarily looks at this thing first, simply no lags, even after forcing my phone to show me some it failed showing any..... What else do you need :) 2) Phone is Handy - Fits in my palm so no need to use both hands and doesnt fall on my face when using it lying down on my bed :P 3) Light weight - As compared to my A110 its Light.... enough said 4) Durable - I actually dropped my phone the other day from a height of 4 feet and had a mini Heart Attack but lucky me its still working no scratch nothing :P remembered those days when i used to fling my Nokia phones around without worrying about a single thing...... :) (Warning dont try this stunt you will end up loosing all that you paid for) 5) Probably I think I was the first one to get an update as no one mentioned about it at that time 10th Sep'14 to be precise :D as soon as i unboxed the phone and connected it to my WiFi I had an update waiting, so expecting Lollipop sooner than other folks :P 6) Sound - OMG the sound is awesome, Dual speakers blow the sound like a stereo set, that is if you have the right media 7) No Heating - Unlike other I didnt notice any heating during calls it only gets heated if Im under the sun for a long time with my Phone exposed to it ... (Its a Black Phone, and Black absorbs Heat, so no complaints) 8) 12.9GB free internal storage - Yes all the apps you want to fill in your phone, Currently I have 94 excluding the pre-installed, so this is enough to prove the phone doenst lag 9) No Boltware - Purely stock android, that means no unwanted apps pre-installed which you wont be using 10) Looks Rich - Yes It does look elegant 11) Games - Works smooth FIFA 14, FIFA 15, Real Racing 3, temple Run works smooooth except for subway surf it lags a bit again no complaints coz my Sis is a crazy fan of Subway and she noticed lags in almost every phone she played on, so no complaints Cons... 1) charge time 3 hrs - Thats not good coz im a impatient man 2) Camera - Camera is a bit grainy in the indoor's but is excellent in the Outdoors.. 3) Ringtone - ascending ringtone wastes 3 second of ring time 4) only ~300mb ram free (Doesnt make a difference to me if there is no lags and no force close, Its only for the Ram hungry guys out there ) hunting for more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and yes awaiting Android Lollipop..................",

The worst thing is that the motorola service centre in chennai is so bad that firstly they don't even pick your calls, so you have to visit them personally just to find out that the replacement costs around Rs. 6000 which is half the cost of the phone. Phone's performance itself is good, but if you are even a little bit of rough user, do not buy this phone.",

Cons: - Screen Resolution Display Appearance is not so good as 1st Gen Moto G. - ICON size is big, which looks odd. (no option to reduce). - There is no 2-in-1 Charger cum Data cable. - No LED indication when device is charge. - Poor Back. Verdict: As I mentioned worth for your penny with upgraded features and missed out the durability of the device when compared to 1st Gen Moto G. If your are looking for a best MANGO in this price range, just go for this.",

But I face this problem on second day only. Further it's working good no problem anything like that Battery life is very good as for average use gives 15-18h and continuous use gives 4.30-5h. The charger is very bad comes in box it charges phone 3.30-4h (0-100%) so I using Samsung Galaxy core charger(5v,1A) which charges just 2.20h (0-100%). No problem with 1gigs ram I installed 32 average apps no lags to be found.working very fine Phone is really water repellent I tested my phone 3 times don't worry about water slash. And never facing any heating problem even when play games, camera ,video playing, charging with Samsung charger (with moto charger it will heats up to 45\u00b0c). But it commonly heats up to 39\u00b0-40\u00b0c in my phone..

Its going nice and easy as till now not much apps or files loaded into it. Eager to know how it would behave under heavy load conditions. One biggest con is that there is no USB cable provided with the product. Camera quality is good but it doesn't zoom more than 4X. No video zooming also. Nice latest OS android 4.4.4 kitkat, upgradable to Upcoming Android5 lollipop. But processor is 1.2ghz only. RAM is also only 1 GB will face difficulty under heavy load conditions, must have atleast 1.5 or 2 GB . Two stereo speakers are given on top and bottom plays nice sound without earphones, But with earphones sound quality is so low ,It's almost unhearable with earphones. Nice sexy look overall. I will rate it 3 and half as below there is option of rating it only either 3 or 4, but i rate it according to overall performance till now. Quality is worth according to its price again i would say \"till now\" :-)",

I ordered(OD100945372712260100) and with exceptional flipkart service I received it on 8th of Oct 2014. I switched on ...but to my surprised nothing appeared on screen, instead there was burning secession on my fingers. I tried multiple time but failed to switch on the device. Initially burning smell was coming out but stopped after few minutes. Unfortunately this time the device was not switched on. I requested for return to flipkart (Return ID: 9582841). Flipkart replaced the product and I got another new set which was switched on successfully. I configured you-tube and starts playing video. After 15-20 minutes I observed that it was started heating up to an extend such that I can not put it on my ear. I turned off wifi/3g data/ location service etc and execute same you-tube tests. Test fails. It was heating up. I have requested another return Return ID: 8364911 Finally I have received my final handset and I am very happy with this product. There is no heating issue at all. 4 star for overall experience. 1 star is deducted for multiple return request. -- Samarjit",

Don't mind the extra weight and thickness; the build quality is definitely superior than any of the Samsung phones.",

Considering my pretty high usage of WhatsApp and Facebook, battery still lasts for an entire day and no, phone doesn't heat up or anything when charging. Camera quality is pretty decent, memory is good too. Just had one problem with phone hanging / freezing in a week's time but that was because of an app I had downloaded, deleted the app, phone back to being awesome since that. (processor maybe)... No USB cable in the box, using my old phone's cable and no, it's not like one of those chargers where USB and charger are same/ connected, there's deff no USB cable and I have checked the box thoroughly. In the box headset is also pretty bad, doesn't fit, is ancient style, deff not cool and hurts my ears. I'm using another headset with the phone so big flop on accessories! Also had to buy the Moto flip case separately- its an awesome case to go with this phone but could have been cheaper, I get great compliments on the case and the phone both! To sum it up, if you want all the features that this phone has (on a universally known and good brand), you deff need to pay around 5-10k more than this. So just because of the disappointing accessories, I give it a 4, else would have been 5 stars with 2 thumbs up!",

I live pretty much at the center of Hyderabad - near Ameerpet - which is why I think this review is important. Flipkart does not deal with the local courier services anymore. We, as Indians, know how these couriers can be erratic and unorganized. But E-kart is a whole new thing. Apparently it is somehow associated with Flipkart - as the driver explains it - and the deliveries are made from a moving truck. This is how it broke down for me. The truck driver calls me 2 hours before hand. He calls me again 30 mins before the delivery. Since I have some business to tend to, I tell him I'd rather pick it up. He tells me exactly where he is (he is delivering at some other address) and asks me to come there. I show up exactly 10 mins later. I pay the money and he has a bill printer with him with which he instantly gives me the bill - just like in a regular retail store. And I have a brand new Moto G! P.S. - The phone is awesome.

I am convinced to write this bcz the problem i shared with flipkart team has got responded and got processed the replacement of earlier dispatched old one with new piece on 11th November. The first motog2 took nearly 5+ hours to charge fully and briskly getting discharged for about 8 hours of normal usage with out internet but new one lasts for longer time,internet access is good on new device.exclusive moto apps make the piece bit unique.

Camera-Motorola has really worked on the camera.the picture clarity has improved by a huge margin.the 8mp camera is way better than the 5mp camera of the Moto G.even the front camera is now better.So full marks to Motorola for improving the camera. Screen Quality-its a 5 inch 720 IPS LCD screen and as usual the quality of the display panel is very good,viewing angles are good too.color reproduction is also very natural and not over saturated. Stock Android experience-The phone is running the latest version of Android.i.e.4.4.4.Kitkat.apart from the 2-3 Motorola apps,there is no bloatware.that's the main reason Motorola did not bump up the processor and the Ram.as the hardware can easily work,multi tasking is also smooth on the phone.no lags. gaming experience is also fun now because of the front dual speakers. Micro SD expansion upto 32gb another feather added in the cap. cons- Motorola could have bumped up the battery capacity upto 2300mah. The phone could be a bit more sleek. Overall i would say this phone is here to stay inspite of the stiff competition.",

When I tried ordering Moto G 2nd gen on Oct 4th, the payment was debited twice. I was not bothered too much because it had happened earlier too and normally the amount would be credited back in a couple of days or maximum one week. Even after a week passed, when I didn't get my money back, I wrote an email to the customer service and have been following up with them till date. Today when I called the Customer care, I was informed that only one order was finalised and the other order (for which the second payment was debited) was only initiated. As I didn't refer the other order number, my complaint has been kept pending for such a long time. I can't understand how I am supposed to quote an order number which I don't know. Now it is almost a month and the customer care guy coolly responds that it will be refunded by November 11th. So, I have got no other go but to pay the credit card bill and wait patiently for these people to refund my amount. I never expected such poor service from Flipkart and mostly this would be my last transaction with Flipkart. Bye. Bye.",

However, as has been rightly pointed out by many, the battery life is pathetic. Hence for that purpose, I have been experimenting about various steps that one can take to ensure satisfactory battery backup. Three things that worked for me: 1. Turn off 3G mode and use 2G, (if you are not a 3G user). 2. Turn off Location. (I saw this as a major contributor to battery life). 3. Turn off Google Now. Or for that matter turn off \"Google Now notifications\" only if you want to use \"OK GOOGLE\" feature. These three turn off's have made my life easier. And my battery life increased two-fold. Thumbs up if you find this useful and let everybody see it. Good Luck. (y)",

I had seen Moto G 1st gen got to know its performance through friends and decided to take the 2nd gen for my dad, too bad the battery drains so fast even when days when absolutely no calls were made and no data transfer, i mean when WiFi and Mobile data were used occasionally. The battery is a big disappointment according to me. Although it has promised for the Lollipop upgrade must wait and see if it can help the battery backup on this device. A big zero for the battery for a tier1 brand like Moto to come up with this big disappointment in Moto G 2nd Gen",

Furthermore When tried to convey my grievance regarding the defects of this product to flipkart executive he simply put phone on hold every time. The battery back is not good as it does not last more than 10 hrs. The SD card slot is not working. I do not understand why flipkart is doing such nonsense by deputing such irresponsible excutive and selling defective product.",

Coming to the phone,it has many issues.The battery is very weak,The ear piece produces a cracking sound during calls,The mobile and the charger heats a lot,The mobile takes nearly 4 hrs to charge,The volume and power buttons are very loose,The ear phone provided is a piece of crap,The touch is not responsive,we can feel the issue with touch screen when we are typing a message(you can test the touch screen issue by keeping your mobile on a flat surface and then type some letters or numbers and try deleting them one by one,by continuously pressing the delete key). The available 400 mb ram falls short during multi tasking,Thinking about motorola service centers is a nightmare. The only good about this phone is that its going to get android L,nothing other than that. I don't know whether it was my bad luck to get defective pieces thrice,or was motorola responsible to ship defective pieces or is flipkart selling us defective and rejected phones. So think before you buy. And one more thing,The mobile comes in different variants some have a good screen,in some the screen is worst,with pink or reddish tint all over it.I have uploaded the images regarding display quality in moto g2 forum,you can check it.",

I must have contacted the flipkart customer care around a dozen times & they lack commitment as well as info regarding the order placed. They are giving commitment of dates which have already passed. I also tried to get in touch with the E-com Prepaid guys but no one answers the damn phone. Now they have cancelled the shipment & are re-shipping the product. Hope it reaches me on time. It was meant to be a birthday gift for someone & now here I am having nothing to give as a present on the day because of flipkart & E-com Prepaid. I am just sharing my experience with flipkart & e-com prepaid so that you can be aware about it before ordering your MOTO G. Please note that I have a similar make & model already purchased from flipkart a month back & the phone is value for money but the site you're buying it from lacks the ability to value its customers.",

It was a horrible and nightmarish experience, So a suggestion, if you are paying 13K, you can certainly pay another Rs 90 for a \"in-a-day\" delivery (if it's available in your pincode). Go for the fast delivery. Don't choose free delivery, it's horrible and terrifying. Now I come to the Review of MOTO G (2nd Gen). I got this phone on 31st october 2014 morning. I'm using this device for 4 days now, so got a decent idea about this phone. >>PROS: 1. GORILLA GLASS 3 Protection. Even Grand 2 don't have this. 2. Water Resistance coating, you can use this phone even in rain. I tested water, It's superbly Water resistant. 3. Android 4.4.4 with guaranteed update to Android L. This mean, you'll have latest android. 4. Excellent HD screen with superb brightness, you can do your work even in sunlight. Just turn the Auto Brightness On. 5. Dual Stereo front speakers are decent. 6. Camera quality is EXCELLENT. I mean it. Superb and fine Pictures are taken from Moto G's default Camera App. Even you can increase it's performance via downloading some awesome camera app from Play Store. 7. Graphic quality and GPU works very fine. Pretty decent experience with gaming and heavy HD gaming. 8. 1GB RAM is good enough for your work. 9. 16 GB Internal storage with 12.3GB of Free space! That is brilliant! 10. I really haven't tested WiFi yet, so can't tell anything about it. 11. Pure Android experience is a big plus. 12. Build quality of Moto G is one of the finest you'll find. 13. Customer care of Motorola is surprisingly awesome. Their Cust. service website's LIve Chat system is Superb! You can solve any of ur problem instantly there! It's a Big Big Help for your any Motorola smartphones. 14. Well, It covers almost all of my needs and hopefully yours also if you have a budget of under 20K. Trust me, I did a long and detailed research about smartphones of Under 20K range, and this is an excellent device to buy! >>> CONS:: 1. Sadly, like EVERY other phone, it has some disadvantages as well, 1st of all id BATTERY. Moto G (2nd Gen) has a bettery of 2070 mAh. Battery drains out pretty fast while you use data connection little bit. while downloading, if you play games, it'll be drains out battery extremely fast. It's very Hard to keep the phone on in a single full charge for 24 Hours. Its Impossible really. Max battery can last 16-18 hours with very moderate use. If you use more than that, you have to charge atleast for a hour to keep it on. So twice charging in a day is must even in a brand new phone! But Charging to 100% don't take too long. Even you can charge it fast by buying a powerfull power bank or anything like that. 2. Quality of headphone is very poor. I suggest, buy a good headset to have a excellent music experience. 3. Moto G 2nd Gen DON\"T HAVE a USB data cable to connect it with PC. So you have to buy it again. It's really sad. 4. Keep the brightness to very low to save battery. Unless its cost too much battery which you can't afford. But With this low brightness, you can do everything superbly. Now, as you can see, Moto G has almost everything to fulfill your demand, but it lacks a strong battery power. But If you use it smartly, and there are several apps in play store to save battery life, which are quite useful, it'll last enough long to serve you. and, Go for official Moto G Shells from Flipkart, yes, it's costly, but It add a brilliant looks and suparb grips to the phone. So I strongly suggests, Use original Moto G shells, it's very very good! Final word: Thumbs Up! You can go for it!",

I'll highly recommend this phone to people... This phone have much better build quality and speed as compared to any of the samsung phone upto 20k price range... this phone have great specifications and features which i'm going to mention below... Display, Processor and OS The New Moto G (2nd gen) arrives with a 5-inch IPS multi-touch display that provides sharp visual experience with a resolution of 720 x 1,280 pixels (HD). The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protected touch responsive display enables you to make transitions between screens, edit photos or access apps at the expense of crisp touches. At the heart of the smartphone, you can find the same 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor functioning in combination with 1GB of RAM to deliver seamless and fast performance with anything you throw at it. It comes preloaded with the stock version of the recently launched Android v4.4.2 KitKat OS. Also in few days probably in mid of nov. 14 this phone will get android L... Camera and Storage The New Moto G (2nd gen) is armed with an excellent 8MP snapper at the rear end which is far better than the 5MP camera available in the outgoing model Moto G. It comes with an LED flash and accompanied by a 2MP shooter above the display. The on board storage capacity of the smartphone is 16GB, which is further expandable by 32GB using a micro SD card. Phone supports OTG also for accessing pendrives and other storage devices.. And works excellent...(u can get a OTG from any phone shop at 50-60 bucks) Battery and Connectivity The New Moto G is furnished with the regular connectivity features like 3G, dual SIM slots, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and USB port. For running the show for a decent amount of time, the smartphone relies on a 2,070mAh li-ion bbatter which runs phone approximatly for whole day. About 19-20hrs of battery backup on 2g.. I used to charge it during night and use it whole day. Cons. Charger is poor, takes too much to charge phone... Approx 4 hrs from 5% to 100%.. Internet surfing is quite decent and smooth. Phone supports both micro sims. Build quality Excellent build quality and really looks great on hands. Back is mat finish with finger print resistance and front part have gorilla glass 3 which is amazingly hard to withstand almost every harsh condition. Phone is splash resistant and repel water coming over it.. Great phone at this price range... Go for it... Have a good day..",

I checked it out and the same day I ordered one. 1) Super delivery...... just 2.5 days to soon to early. 2) 8 MP is 8 MP... not like others promising 8 mp and clarity is not even 5MP 3) Battery.. 5 star to the battery. but The charger heats up. Same issue pertains with moto g and E 4) Processor is awesome. Android 4.4.4 Rocks. no issues with the ram. I even played fifa 14 in it. 5) Speakers are loud and clear. 6) Touch is awesome and royal. Thus I conclude that Moto G2 is a superb pick keeping in mind that u are upgrading your self i.e. after using a low budget cell around 6 - 9k. Wont recommend this phone to all those who were earlier using cells arnd 25-30k. they will never like it. Best cell at its price.",

Now let\u2019s start some of its negative points:- \u2022 The rear camera glass is having spots and minor scratches. \u2022 The Camera stopped responding 3-4 times in a day. Then I have to restart the phone. \u2022 Camera Auto Focus feature hang the phone, due to which phone need to be restarted \u2022 Unable to apply Google Drive 50GB offer. \u2022 After that Flipkart arranged the Replacement. But after replacement I found another issue in new one and that was; \u2022 SIM 2 Slot is having some internal defect:- If I want to insert micro SIM into slot number 2 then the SIM lock mechanism will not hold the micro SIM until I try to insert it again and again for 15 \u2013 20 times. The same SIM is getting insert only in one time into slot number 1. Even tried to replace the micro SIM but the problem with SIM slot number 2 is same. Note: - Flipkart provided the best support to resolve all problems but these are the manufacturing defects. Flipkart delivered the manufacture sealed product both times, so how can anybody know about these issue before using the product. Motorola must ensure the quality of their products than the sale quantity and Flipkart must escalate these issues to Motorola quality check team.",

Overall the Phone just about meets expectations but could have been better.",

The front speakers are loud and clear . Battery-the major drawback with this phone with 3G surfing you could go for about 6-8 hours while playing games for about half an hour the device heats up too much . The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything. Conclusion -happy with overall performance only drawback is its battery and heating .",

I wondered today, when I received the product. It was in the process if giving the money back to me. I was waiting for a long time for the refund of money as they asked 8 business days. When I called them today they are telling that they will need 3 more days for pick up the product and another 8 days for processing. Are they thing I am a fool. Now Bank is asking me to pay for both the transaction. Really I got mad because of Flipkart and running behind them on call. No proper service as well.",

But, I'm not satisfied with the brand Motorola because I replaced my phone two times. 1st replacement is for defective top speaker. 2nd replacement is for not receiving latest update and a damaged pixel. Battery: 1. After a week usage found that average screen time (phone usage time) is 5 Hours and 30 minutes only which is really terrible. 2. It will take at least 3 Hours and 40 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%. Now I feel like its again a defective piece that I got. Accessories recommendation: 1. Noise Back Cover for Moto G (2nd Gen). 2. Do not buy cheap Tempered glass because it will affect touch sensitivity. Design: * It feels and looks like a premium phone. * But when it comes to its physical size Moto G 1st gen feels compact. * Feels bit heavier. Features: * Simple and beautiful launcher UI which better than Moto G 1st gen. * After updating to System version 21.11.23 we will get \"Ok Google\" support. * It is one of the few phones which will get Android L upgrade. Performance: * Pictures taken with LED flash and artificial lighting are good. * Front camera lags always. * After installing \"clean master\" with enabled real time protection battery like is OK for normal use otherwise it is worst. But I hope it will be fixed in Android L upgrade. * It takes 3hrs to charge from 1% to 100% with the given adapter. * WiFi connectivity is not so good its almost like that we have to sit in the same room where the WiFi router is installed. * Great GPS and GLONASS connectivity(Good navigation system).",

The specifications are more than sufficient for a normal user. Firstly if you use your phone a lot of phone calls and emails, I would only recommend this phone. The quality of the phone is very important. Mi3 lacks this big time. The phone does heat up eventually! Secondly moto g shape is amazing. It fits in your hand & pockets easily thanks to its design. Mi3 is straight and usually it does fall out. Mi3 has a much better screen but its not that big a factor! Pros: Brilliant design and built quality. Very user friendly Amazing after sales service Output on headphones is superb! Doesn't hang/lag at all!! (Irrespective of ram size) Made for business use Cons: Camera is strictly OK Not great for experimentation like if you are a developer! USB cable is not included! Go ahead and buy it. U won't regret!",

Now coming to device ,I am posting this review after using for 2 weeks. Looks of Device is Good,Though i didn't like those front facing speakers look wise,they look better in previous version.Display is bright enough and touch is crispy. Pros: Good Performance Decent Camera Display Quality Good Cons: Battery Life is not good(giving me 12-14 hours on average uses on 3G network) I didn't like look of front Speakers (Looks cheap to me) though its my personal opinion.",

Screen: Bright and colorful with awesome viewing angles and a screen to fall in love with. Sound: This what I loved the most, two front facing speakers - Loud & Crisp quality. Camera: A necessary upgrade from last years Moto G, now with 8MP and a quality to be cherished and a breathtaking Slow motion video capturing. Front also serves a decent quality. Battery: Though the same size battery should be a drawback, but it serves more than what one can think. It last for more than 30 hours. To sum up, It is Magical to hold a Moto G2 as it is Sexy, beautiful and bold. Proud owner of a MOTO. :)",

You are not able to speak continiously for more than 15/20 mins. It is not bearable near your ear. so think twice before investing in this phone The reply from flipkart to this complaint was more annoyed. As per flipkart this is normal and it is not a defect. 2) The 3.5 mm jack is not working with all the headphones. I tried with my last nokia headphones and it is not working Again the answer for the same was more annoyed. Flipkar conveyed me that it is recommended that you should only use motoroal headset. I dont know if flipkart and motorola really had any engineers with with them to convey the meaning of standardisation. The bottom line moto g has their exclusive 3.5 mm jack and if it works with other headphones then you are really lucky 3) On playing video or recording vidieos it heats up exceptionally. Again flipkart says it is normal.. and you will not get any replacement. Please beware of purchasing on discount as you may get substandard mobiles",

In the bargain I have lost 7000 bucks from februaury till november 2014. Plus enough inconveniences and loss of time energy and data. Moto G 2nd gen, is a faulty phone. Promises 1GB RAM but still most of he Apps crash mid way. Awful display, one odd day i saw all blurred display, swicthed off and then turned on then it got sorted. Happens every now and then. Volume is a complete turn off and so is the experience. Had ordered for a refund on 16th Oct and they are still \"getting back to\" me. This time I will make sure that Flipkart repays me all the money and time and energy lost in \"trusting in\" them. Moto G is just an OK phone, a poor man's nexus!!

Camera quality is average, After taking 10 to 12 images in normal use it is not responding as well as whole device gets hang, and warming up no it is not correct word it is heating up very high temperature. Upper area around the camera hardware. 2. Internet connectivity is also not impressive having much trouble to using 3G. 3. Loud speaker for calling is not good and notification sound+ vibration is too low. 4. Service centers are available only in big cities. But I am 100% sure that Motorola / Google will fix this Camera and connectivity problem. UI has to be improve. I also request to flipkart that please convey this message with Motorola. I got replacement for same problem & other one. Motorola and Flipkart gives me full attention both made goodwill. I appreciate to both of these organization. This is my own genuine experience.",

            "comment": "before the product review i would like to address flipkart first . Dear flipkart , Your customer service sucks period .....I bought moto g 2nd gen on 7 oct with promised delivery date of 10th oct . then it shifted to 17th oct and finally product was delivered on 29th oct, i not joking . there was no communication from flipkart . your so called call canter have no clue when product is going to deliver . ............if flipkart did't have monopoly over moto product i would have cancelled my order and bought it from some where else .. product review :- moto g is very attractive phone in person and in specs but there is dark side to moto g pro 1.moto g is made of soft plastic it feels excellent in hand . 2.pure android cons 1.flipkart sucks 2.moto g have major battery issue . phone takes more than 5hrs to charge fully . if your a heavy user like me you need look some where where else (heavy on call not on games) . 3.moto is pure android but it started to lag within two days. (no games installed) 4.camera is not up to the mark . a.software lags b. bad in low lighting overall camera performance is disappointing. 5.google search is not working properly . 6. volume and power button are of very bad quality. it doesn't give confidence at all. i have previously owned blackberry bold , nokia e72 and lg l5 . conclusion if your a college student and want a phone for cheap wait for some time because there will be second hand market soon. don't buy this phone if your caller, gamer .",

No lag occur whatsoever. Though 1GB RAM does look less at times it doesn't affect a lot provided you aren't doing heavy multitasking. The battery life will seem a bit less for people into gaming. Rest assured. If you aren't interested in getting into Xiaomi and Micromax and want a product with stock android and guaranteed software updates, moto g 2014 is the best at this price.",

First of all, when I got this product,there weren't any Motorola logo or name on the screen guard(I seen it when one of my friend bought it). I didn't care about it initially but when these issues came up I got a feeling like my phone is already used(?). 2.sometimes I cannot accept calls, when i swipe to receive the calls the phone just don't respond. 3.I got electric shock from the speaker when connected to my laptop via USB cable. It is taking a pretty long time (About 4 hrs)to charge the phone fully. 4.when I unplug the headphone during call, the phone puts the call on loudspeaker automatically. I have raised an issue already, hope you guys will provide me a good customer service.",

            "comment": "I am basic user with just basic internet surfing, FB, Chat & emails. 1st time used Android phone & I rarely change my cell phone so use one phone for 6-7 years. Hence do a deep review before buying any phone. So here is my review eKart Delivery:- not so good would give them 2 out of 5; where 5 being highest. About Phone Awesome phone, great screen size, no crap apps, super fast, people use 2 view my phone & compliment tht its awesome fast & looks great, v easy 2 use for a new Android user like me, Looks awesome frm back & gives Nexus feel. People use 2 ask me is it Nexus. due 2 its dark black screen & thin size.just loved all the compliments I received & this handset made me feel special. Updates are fast frm google-Moto Pro:- Look & feel, light weight, slim, very fast, easy 2 use, screen display, high volume, lengthy charge, pre attached good screen guard, auto brightness does awesome task in sunlight or in dark. Cons:- No file explorer installed, so u need 2 have internet for sure 2 download it, Fm Radio can not be played on speakers :) no big deal. Battery saver only starts once battery reaches 15% 1st Handset was having huge network breaking issues, other person was not able 2 hear me, calls getting disconnected, but was getting Awesome internet surfing speed even when network was low, never heated even while watching 3 hours of Movie, Voice frm earpiece was coming frm left side i.e when you talk on phone u can feel voice is more loud when you are listening frm left ear & its low when you are listening frm right ear. Hence in huge noisy place I had 2 use phone 2 listen frm left ear or adjust it on right ear so as 2 get more sound. Hence assuming hardware issue with sounds & network I got it Replaced. 2nd Phone:- Screen guard not placed properly. frm the way it was stuck seems like it was placed just in hurry & sems like was not a factory stuck screen guard. Also there is no logo on screen guard frm Moto, the phone is not sealed packed in plastic. so no way 2 know if its original or refurbished phone. But thts how Moto has kept its strategy. so as 2 benefit by selling even refurbished handsets as new .... hence felt like I got a refurbished handset, Voice again was coming more frm left side of handset, so thought this is how the phone was designed so ignored this prob. But started facing heating prob.. the first half of phone frm Top specially the back side area where camera is located use 2 heat a lot while using internet for one hour or using internet along with phone charging & if you receive call at same time .. u cant even touch it 2 your ear.. so have 2 remove charging listen call for couple of mins frm distance & then it use 2 cool down fast..but after charging again starts heating.. but with no use only charging it become normal. This 2nd phone use 2 take approx 6-7 hours 2 charge tht too not reaching 100%. Called customer care of Flipkart for replacement.. thy suggested refund. I loved this phone so didn't wanted refund for sure. .still opted for refund due 2 pressure frm pears. NOW Most Important .. while the refund was in progress just 2 days before pick up .. I removed the default screen guard of phone & the look of screen was just too AWESOME .. believe me its like a 3d .. super cool.. but then walking on sun light if you see the phone (non active mode in blank screen) u can see lots n lots of vertical & horizantal lines behind the glass .. looked like I can see the chips behind the screen. But thought since the screen quality is awesome hence Moto has purposely kept it like tht. Hence decided 2 cancell the refund but called Moto G customer care for 2nd opinion .. & 2 my shocker thy told me..tht the hearing prob tht the voice coming frm left side of phone is a hardware issue & needs 2 be fixed at service center & vertical lines are not normal hence the phone again needs 2 get replaced. Flipkart also confirmed tht the lines are not normal. Considering these 2 facts tht voice coming more frm left side of phone.. which i faced on both 2 handsets & vertical lines tht I explored only in 2nd handset .. I decided 2 go for refund. Heating prob is normal in all the phones even Samsung I have seen all my friends complaining about heating issue. Also battery is just for half day with basic use.. but thts due 2 HD & bigger screen. Conclusion:- still MotoG is the best phone 2 buy, as it has a big big brand name behind & support of Google, awesome performance & still the best comparing 2 samsung.xiomi,asus .. great after sales service, once you are done with one month support frm flipkart .. after sales service does makes a huge impact It seems tht either Flipkart is selling refurbished handsets or MotoG quality check department is messing up all the handsets .. as receiving 2defective handsets is not common .. most of my friends using this phone are not facing any issues except me .. so its bit depressing tht I have been left with such bad experience & can not buy this awesome phone",

It's a sub phone that gives a surprising number of plus in mid-range handsets a real run for its money, I didn't think it was possible to create a better phone than the original Moto G, but the latest version of Motorola's unstoppable handset rightly claims its crown.",

The most frustrating experience was not being able to track the shipment. I was following up with Flipkart and the logistics company (Ecom Express) everyday and they kept giving me vague replies. Flipkart itself did not have a clue on where the shipment was and they kept telling me, ' we have escalated the issue'. God knows where they have escalated the issue. The logistics company was on a different level altogether. They told me that there was a huge backlog of orders and they cannot do anything about it.

Camera quality: Primary camera on the phone is way too much good for a Moto and secondary camera is good for video calling as it supposed to. Also works well low light condition. 2. Speakers: I found that these speakers are very good in sound production. 3. Build quality: Phone sits well in short hands also because of it's build quality 4. Touch response: This is the major term in every touch phone. Mobile's touch is good but when touching with nails, response is not well (S3 touch works well with wet fingers and nails). 5. Waterproof quality: Works well in rainy season and washroom usage. Thanks to the water repellent coating (S3 is not good in under water condition) Overall review: This is a good phone in mid price range with promised upgrade to Lollipop.",

I think is not a new brand piece. it is second hand / used phones. I am already inform to flipkart by telephonic and writing both on immediately after receipt of the Moto G (2nd Gen). Still no action by flipkart. First time i have face this types of problem and also I am not happy with flipkart services. Please be care full..",

            "comment": "Moto G(2) is a good phone overall and price is pretty competitive too. But, there were some significant critical bugs/defects with either the phone handset or the android-motorola combo, and here they are: 1. USB cable is not included in package - this is a bummer!!!! 2. PC-USB connections do not work for Win XP (SP3) and Moto G. I have spent almost 3 entire days to do some R&D in techie sites, yet to implement the 9th or 10th resolution. Works fine with my other laptop with Win 8.1. Therefore, if you expand your mem slot 3. I have purchased 2 Moto G phones and 1 Moto G (2) phone in the span of 1 month from flipkart. For none of these purchases, the headphone works! This is crazy - and I have used my existing Philips, Nokia, Samsung, Micromax headphones and Moto G failed to detect the outlet and produces no sound at all. 4. For Moto G(2), a little stressed usage (4/5 apps opened together; remember - other than the usuals) just show some hiccups in the phone smoothness. 5. Motorola has kept the same display clarity as of M(1) into M(2), but the screen is 0.5'\" bigger; so if you compare the display in 1 & 2, you'd obviously find some shady pixelated display. 6. Sometimes, most weirdly, my home-screen app icons disappear, sometime I notice them sitting in another home-screen. I am pretty particular about my customized home-screens (5 years of touch-phone usage .. LOL) and this is really crazy. 7. If I recall more, I will note them down too. Overall: It's a good budget phone with lots of usable and few rubbish extended features. But the customization of android kitkat by Motorola has been proved to be really so useless. Note: Moto G (Gen1) was perfect in terms of these strange creepy problems.",

I used this phone to fulfill all my requirements such as accessing my corporate, private emails, whatsapp, social media, taking long video conferencing calls, accessing my office network and receiving calls on my cellphone etc. I was very happy about the performance. Post office hours it was owned by my daughter who is very fond of watching youtube videos. it gave me very good uninterrupted video quality. In the morning I played songs directly from Gaana.com and no issues. Till September month, I was very happy with this phone. Due to my mistake I carried this phone on the beach and one wave changed my life. In a second, I was phoneless. The water has damaged my phone and for sometime until battery was alive, phone was alive but I was not able to use touch screen so was not able to receive any call. I was out of station so I did not have access to my old phone and I was also not have access to the service center. When I came back and went to the PC support which is the only service center in Pune. There is a huge rush with the Moto G related complains and somehow I managed to attract one of the customer executives and he accepted my phone in warranty and I was expecting from them what has happened to the phone and how much I have to pay if there is anything needs to be raplaced. They said I will receive a callback within 3 days. I kept waiting for the call for the whole week but did not get any call so I started calling them back. I kept them calling but they did not receive the call. Finally someone answered the call but he kept saying Hello Hello but he did not reply my query. Finally when I kept trying for one week then someone received call and asked my details and asked to pickup my repaired phone after 2 days. I was happy that my phone got repaired then I received another call after 2 days that my phone's motherboard got damaged so it needs to be replaced and it will cost me 7500. During this time there were Diwali offere going on and I lost all the offeres because I was optimistic for my phone. Motorola should improve the overall service experience. Finally I bought Moto G gen 2 because I liked phone but service experience was very bad.",

I've been using it for 2days and I'm revelling in the pure Google experience on 4.4.4 KitKat! The design is understated and classy. I'm not using any case for it and so far the white back didn't take any stains. The Matt finish of the White back masks fingerprints and looks clean. Easy to manage. There is a slight tendency for dust to accumulate at the edges of the front where the screen meets the panel. The only limiting thing is the battery. Gives me a maximum of 16hrs with moderate use and a maximum screen on time of 4 and a half hrs. Motorola Plugin earphones of the very basic variety come within the box. The camera is good (not the best one out there) and keeps the pictures looking natural. If u r a gamer, u'll just fall in love with the performance of this phone! Gives the most amazing gaming experience! Overall, its a great buy",

I informed over customer care to flipkart persons who advised to create Return and also advised to try it with another charger.Before I could tell them that the phone started charging with another charger, and without knowing the facts they disapproved my return request. The next day I over phone informed them the fact and requested them to replace the charger with new one because the original /branded charger is the integral part of the mobile. I then made request to them to replace the defective charger. with new one. But contacting them several times at their customer care, they are not replacing. This is my bad experience. I would rather suggest that purchaser should insist for open delivery of items purchased so that they can verify the item before making payment to them. My rating may be treated as zero..",

[gave a wow feeling when i opened the box] * Crisp 5' HD display(720p). * Camera - 8MP takes pics with good clarity; 2MP - great selfie. * Speakers - Simply superb - Literally blown away by the Stereo speakers - Awesome !! * 16 GB internal memory + Micro SD card slot. * Android 4.4.4 with sure upgrade to \"Android L\". * Quad core speed - tried few games like Real racing, Riptide - ran smoothly.",

To my surprise the Screen of the phone does not respond to any kind of touch. I waited for almost 4 days for this product just to get the feel of online shopping and sad to say that no matter what, purchase via ecom will take lot more doing to ensure customer satisfction from the retailer side before they can make a big game changer preposition. Saddened and all the excitement of buying a new phone is transformed into a sad experience.",

            "comment": "I had ordered the phone on Flipkart before Diwali. Although, Flipkart ruined my Diwali and messed up the timelines quoting their logistics partner as the culprit, the phone by itself is flawless. I was upgrading from a Samsung galaxy Star and was used to android. However, the experience is beyond wonderful with the new Moto G. my friend who owns a 1st gen phone had recommended Moto and I had zeroed in only after carefully considering the Zenfone5, the Samsung Mega and also a few other phones like Sony Experia Z and Lenovo and Alcatel-Lucent. The Display is bright enough for regular use but dim enough to conserve battery when need be. The touch Screen is very responsive and so is the camera. having Motorola migrate, moving my contacts from the old phone was a breeze. The UI with the Google now launcher is integrated on Android 4.4.2 Kitkat. The specs may not seem as high as the zenfone,but Moto have a way of optimizing the performance so they perform way better compared to other phones with slightly higher specs. Summarizing, I would definitely recommend this phone although i would add that it takes ages for the phone to charge with the Moto provided charger and that the earphones seem too cheap but perform as expected from Moto. I would expect a more flashy/customizable pair of earphones though.",

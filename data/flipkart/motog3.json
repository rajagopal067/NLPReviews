            "comment": "I bought this phone in February with a lot of hopes and positive vibes as it was in the bestseller list back then(I don't know if its in there anymore). It came with android kit-kat and it worked just perfectly. DISAPPOINTMENTS : . I updated it to android lollipop back in april. The experience has been extremely disappointing after that. The phone hangs a lot, stops responding, behaves in a weird manner, touch screen lags and just forget about high end gaming experience as it does not even support the basic games properly now. Talking about the battery life, it does not even last a day so if you are planning to place an order then add a power bank in your cart too(its a must), which means another 2000 bucks. . Memory, 1 GB of ram is simply not enough for a lollipop update, I don't know any technicalities but it just does not feel enough. . I wanted a phone which handles multi-tasking well but it simply does not(same problem, hangs a lot). I have seen cheaper phones with the same configurations performing so well than this. . Heating issues(sometimes). . Speakers stop working after 10 minutes of music playback(headphones/earphones work just fine). . Camera focus, it just does not work. Every time I land up with an unfocused image. That's it. No more disappointments. :) shop safe :P",

The phone once got into sleep mode for long duration, never activates the display on clicking the power button. It then requires a restart. I thought Andriod 5.0.2 is the culprit, but turned out it\u2019s not. The service center in Kochi is so pathetic that, for everything they will ask to replace motherboard, which I did. But the problem is still persisting. I have escalated this and waiting to hear from the manufacturer.",

Unfortunately its display stopped working after couple of weeks of purchasing it so I took it to local authorized service center of Motorola. They took my phone, issued me job sheet and told me that they do not have required spare part in their stock so it will take around 10-12 days time in getting it repaired. I sent an email to Motorola same day requesting them to send required spare part to service center so my phone can be repaired sooner. I received an acknowledgment from them they the matter has been escalated to higher authorities. Neither service center received required part nor did I receive any reply from Motorola after that. I again sent two reminders to Motorola by email but all vain. It was September 10, 2015 when my phone was taken by service center and now it is September 25, 2015 but my phone is not fixed due to unavailability of required spare part and I do not see any sign of spare part coming. It is so negligence and ignorance of Motorola. I am surprised to see so worst level of customer service of Motorola. Details of service center are as below: Service note job # AMSAGR000252 GIN # GINAGR000261 ELS date & time September 10, 2015 6:07:25 PM Will Motorola officials pay attention on this or I made one of the biggest mistake of my life in purchasing Motorola device?

So based on this good experience i decide to buy same phone moto g2 (2nd) for my wife but this time i disappointed very much from its display and camera quality. Although Motorolla has reduced it price as compare to last year but its quality reduction is more than its price. 1. Its display looks purple during standby mode. same can be easily differentiate. It feels like low cost chines phone. 2. A very thin wire mesh is present on screen (when see from side of display) 3. Touch is missing some time. 4. Camera quality is also degraded. 5. One of SIM holder not working properly and hold the SIM in four-five tries. It happens every time. I have both phones (Moto g2 2nd gen) purchased last year and second phone purchased last week. So above point are based on actual comparison between them.",

My phone (MotoG -2nd Gen.) got damaged inside out coz of water damage and now service centre guyz at Motorola are not providing any replacement (though it is in warrenty period- purchased on 10th June). So dear flipkart, have your QC Dept. have enough balls to provvide me a replacement?? At least have you enough guts to accept the thing that YOU ARE PROMOTING THE PRODUCT FALSELY??",

First piece had major problem with battery, it needed to charge 2-3 times a day also it used to hang a lot. I asked flipkart Motorola support to replace the phone, the test for phone performance was good but their suggestions to improve performance were very funny. They asked me to stop the apps that are using maximum RAM whenever I stop using those apps all the time. Is this the way to improve phone performance? Later on got replacement from flipkart. Second piece was working fine, until I updated the phone. After I updated the phone, the camera quality became worst, every image comes blurred. Phone takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. Now I'll need to factory reset the phone. Otherwise the phone is ok. I don't play any games but I do watch lots of videos on it. But I can't switch between multiple apps at a time otherwise it will hang. Pros: 1. Good camera quality 2. Nice touch screen 3. Video and Sound quality is good Cons: 1. Poor battery (drains faster) 2. 1GB RAM against 16GB internal memory is not enough at all. The phone hangs most of the time.",

Requested for a refund but was met with a few disappointing customer service minions arguing their level of logic; however, some of the senior folks (special mentions to Mr. Venkatesh/Mr. Shiva) were able to rescue the situation and help with my refund. Thanks again Flipkart for restoring the consumers' belief in what is soon becoming a dependable brand for Indian e-Commerce! :)",

I mean it has all the basic features which now a days any android phone has but that is not what is expected from Motorola. Since day one the phone battery has been troubling me. It takes at least 4 hours of continuous charging to get fully charged and even after charging fully battery hardly lasts for a day. And all this crappy performance for a user like me who doesn't use phone for anything except internet surfing and whatsapp. On top of it I tried to put a return request over three times, but the response from Flipkart is pathetic and unexpected. I was told by customer care executive that it is normal for any android phone to take 4 hours to charge and battery back up of a day is normal too. Customer care executive also advised me not to use third party applications as it consumes more battery. Now that's a six...I mean if you can't use TP applications why would I buy a smart phone? A total wastage of money don't go for it",

After i received the the new phone i unboxed it and the 1st thing i did was to switch on the phone, its display is vivid , crisp and very good. The video quality on the moto g2 was good.The new moto g2 feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter.The camera is pretty good on the g2.Sound quality is pretty good on the moto g2. Also i like the way Flipkart ships the products :) Delivery & support is very good !!",

Very poor quality of battery, getting hot very earlier, calling sound quality not good. The major problem is with display it is continuously flukes when brightness kept at low level. When I capture the images with rear camera the images that I capture are not clear, they are blurred. Video shooting is also blurred. The biggest problem that I have faced that handset doesn't support 16 GB memory card however the handset supporting capacity is 32 GB (Very Funny). Anyways there are other minor problems that I won't describe here. I want to return the Handset to the company because I am not satisfied with the Handset & the Company service when I am investing Rs. 11000/- in a very CHEAP HANDSET. If any support & action is not taken against my review then I will approach to the CONSUMER COURT seeking reimbursement of Handset & other expenses regarding the problem.",

Had to charge everyday for normal usage.

The mobile does not hang unlike Samsung, may be because the stock android installed in moto. The battery back up is just okay for 1 day for voice calls and 1 to 2 hrs of data usage. But, if videos, data and apps are used extensively, power bank is a must. The stock android is a little user unfriendly, but the performance of the software obviates that small disadvantage and one would get used to the tricks easily. But, as i said in the beginning, the biggest plus point is that the mobile is value for the money (Rs.10K). We can throw it after one year and buy a new mobile with latest specs. I had used samsung for 2 years earlier that was bought at 25k and the comparison is very simple and obvious for me.",

Some of guys think of 3G and 4G mobile but i feel now, 3G is better. After purchasing 4G mobile I have noticed that there is very fast Data consumption in 4G. However 4G gives good speed but there is only difference of 19-20 in 4G & 3G and now i feel my Moto G2nd gen was really better. Many of have written battery back is low but the more battery back means you are keeping higher risk in your pocket. In this product there is nothing like it last a whole working day and you can charge in night for next day. Also Flipkart service is really very good.",

Considering this has a stock Android installed, there have been no issues related to the phone hanging despite having multiple applications open in the background. Started seeing a bit of lag after upgrading the OS to Lollipop 5.0. As most of you might already be aware, the memory leak issue has been a major drag on the resources of the phone. Desperately awaiting the Lollipop 5.1 upgrade to fix the darn issue! The battery backup has been decent. It lasts for a day on standard usage including being on the W-fi for the whole day. The battery saver mode on the Lollipop OS is another boon in case you intend to travel for an extended period. Overall a really great buy!",

Main issues facing till date are during call the person on opposite side can hear my voice but I cant hear him, this problem is since i have bought the phone. More over caller is getting echo voice when ever he speaks. Also there is an issue with network connectivity. Initially i used Airtel sim, when ever call is dropped network signal also gets dropped. So, thought its an Airtel issue. Later moved to vodafone on mobile portability. Same issue again. I used to get more calls every day, every one complaints about these issues. I suggest dont ever buy any motorola mobiles",

As my friend suggested me to try buying product @ Flipkart I had decided to buy \"Moto G (2nd Generation)\". This is the worst phone, does not catch signals nor wifi. I feel I have a dummy phone in hand where I cant make calls nor check internet despite having 3G mobile data. The issue has got nothing to do with the mobile service provider as I have a Samsung phone and another number which works perfectly fine. As I am new to online shopping never realized I could return the product. Never thought Flipkart products are this bad. This is my first and last buy from Flipkart.",

It totally stopped charging about 10 days ago.The service center guys told me that charging port comes under physical damage and is hence not covered under warranty. but if the charging port is intact how can there be an external physical damage..on top of that they don't have their own service centers..you'll have to stand in line for hours before you finally get your chance. The customer care and service center people are rude and insensitive.I've used Samsung, Nokia in the past and i never faced any such issues before...Motorola is duping people with such frivolous warranty arrangements...their charging port is of inferior quality and they don't even want to cover it under their warranty.If a device is developing problems under normal usage, then they should be able to cover it under their warranty..They can advertise all they want on TV..but you can only know about the quality of a brand, when you approach their service center...and for me Motorola is among the worst in India...was planning to go for G3 but will never ever buy a moto and not recommend others to buy it..",

But they are saying that they cant listen my voice so disconnecting the call and sending a message that they will call tomorrow. it was happening from last 2 days. It looks like they are making a drama and try to forcing me to use a defective product. It is very very bad from Flipkart.",

I had requested Flipkart for a replacement and they have called back to perform remote diagnostic tests and concluded saying the mobile is proper and they canceled my replacement request. The heating problem started and again requested and they rejected by saying lame things. Third time also same thing happened and I stopped calling Flipkart people because I got pissed off. I said to Flipkart customer care every time, please replace this mobile within one month as per the replacement policy otherwise if I call 2nd month you will say replacement policy is period has crossed. Same thing happened now, today my mobile got heated up and all the data is lost. I called Flipkart and said the same thing, and as anticipated they replied what I had expected. They said, as per flipkart replacement policy we can\u2019t give you any replacement or refund because this is 2nd month. After this, I have called Motorola customer care explained the problem, they told that I can get refund because I have raised complaint within one month as per Flipkart replacement policy. This Flipkart people are not accepting my request which is unethical by giving faulty mobile to me and gaming me until the first month is over and now denying replacing the phone because it is the second month. Any way I will not keep quite till they will refund money or replace my fault Moto 2nd G mobile. I am registering complaint in consumer court. I will flood this cheating news all over the Internet so that other consumers are aware of this tactic when they get a faulty product.",

The phone display has some problem, the brightness level is much below the standards of regular MotoG2 handset. Also there is yellow tint in the display. I requested for a replacement, Flipkart technician called me and asked to install a SmartCheck application. With this application they did few display tests and did not find a problem. How can someone test the phone display remotely and conclude there are no problems. The display brightness is extremely low, at minimum level it is almost invisible. Extremely Disappointed with Flipkart return policy, will think twice before I use next Flipkart service. If you are one among those who get a defective item through Flipkart you are unlucky, strictly avoid electronic items thorough Flipkart.",

But one thing that was not fine in my last 5 months of usuage was the battery. From the very first day it takes nearly 3 to 4hrs to get fully charged. It was very bad when compared to other mobiles of this range because other mobiles getting fully changed by 1hr or within 2hrs. But i am worried that i got some defective pice since other Moto G 2nd generation users dont face this issue while changing the mobile. Also the battery was draining fastly when we play online games (ratio was like if you play 10 mins in online then 10 to 15 % charge will be lost). But if you not using internet the battery serves nicely for 2 days. But when using net and that too online games its draining very much faster.",

Flipkart proudly announced it's delivery well in advance, but doesn't it care about the authenticity about the recipient too? The delivery boys care even less. They do not even ask for the identity of the recipient. When I tracked my shipment (which was directed to an educational institution), I find the order status as delivered & that the recipient has signed my dad's name, which is not true! My dad was not even there at that time & someone impersonated him & the agents just need a signature in their delivery sheet's column. Now I don't know who has the shipment. We are frantically searching for it. Flipkart please take note of this & don't think your job is done once you have shipped the item from your warehouse. It is YOUR responsibility to see it through. Otherwise, there will be a shower of 1/5 star ratings and such reviews from disappointed consumers like myself.",

I bought a moto G 2nd generation phone on 13th April 2015 and exactly 4 months later my mobile phone is not in working condition anymore. It has just become a toy, a toy of worth Rs 12000/-. Although the mobile is within the warranty period I have been told by the Motorola customer care that they wont be able to repair the same as the main board has been damaged and falls under liquid damage category. But the truth is that I kept my phone always in a safe place and it was never kept in any kind of compromising position. My questions and concerns regarding Motorola phone services are very serious as Rs 12000/- is not a joke. Everybody works hard for every single penny they earn. My phone was not exposed to any kind of liquid and it turns out to be really annoying when I hear that my phone will not fall under warranty. I am sick and tired of this warranty policy terms and conditions bla bla bla. I am a Ph.D scholar in Jadavpur University and one thing is for sure that I won\u2019t suggest the Motorola phones to anybody in future. Another thing is that we buy phones depending on reveiws of the mobile phones out here and find that one out of many has complaints or has given a low rating but the fact is that u will face the problem once you have bought the phone because it has got the worst service of all Thanking You Yours Sincerely Sukalpa Choudhury",

I think it should operate at 2 GB ram with a battery charger with a USB port cable and may be a good phone then. I also wonder whether the 16 GB storage is there or not!! comparing Moto E with similar applications and lot of games in it, I think 16 GB capacity is not virtually available in the system!

I had requested Flipkart for a return/exchange which got rejected - tried the second time and got rejected again, hope the 3rd times the charm. Buyers - a word of advice, please do take the reviews seriously before purchasing a discounted product on flipkart. Especially when to comes to purchasing electronics.",

Awesome display at this price. The pixel density and the scratch proof screen is really value for money. 2. The camera quality in outdoor is superb, for indoor it's average. 3. Touch screen sensitivity is also very good. 4. Few utilities like Moto Assist & Alert are really useful. 5 Negative: 1. RAM is 1G only. So at start it might seem to be enough but later when you have 2-3 open apps the performance starts degrading. 2. Battery is not strong enough to survive one day of moderate usage. (Gaming excluded) 3. The earphone sucks bigtime plus no volume control option. So considering the Moto g3 out in the market and price dropping down, it is indeed a great choice in this price range. But again after 4-5 months the performance degrades drastically.",

I have received phone on 27.06.2015. When I fond this thing is happening I have requested to return my phone to Flipkart for software issue. Then I received call from Flipakart I have been told to reset the phone. I have done accordingly & it worked for 10-15 days. But now still I am facing the same issue. And now I can't return the phone as 30 days are over. Second one is when enable \"Adaptive Brightness\" it doesn't work at all.I don't know what exact happens but brightness remains the same as it is in dark room also and in lighted room also. I am giving ratings on the basis of above issue faced by me but as I said above all other things are working properly but due to first issue some times I feel irritating.",

The positive things first: - Really good grip and smart look - Google apps smartly integrated - Very competitively priced - Excellent picture and video quality, shoots really well in low light conditions - Hard scratch proof screen (so u need not even put a screen cover) - Enough storage space and dual SIM slots - Big screen size to fit in all the most used apps and notifications Now the negatives: - The battery life is a real showdown - have to charge everday irrespective of use - Not possible to personalise ringtone - SMS does not have one of the most useful feature - 'drafts' - No touch screen feature to turn the phone to silent / vibrating mode - Poor quality head phones - The charger should have detachable data cable - Creating profiles is not possible - Turns slow when multiple applications are used Though I would still rate this in the mid range of the scale given that it helped me to upgrade in terms of the enhancements I was looking for in a smart phone.

Since it was under warranty, I contacted flipkart for authorized service center in Allahabad which is nearest city from my location. I was told by flipkart that SRK Electronics is the authorized service center in allahabad. Once I reached there, I came to know that the service center has been closed since very long. There was another address mentioned there which was claimed to be authorized one. Therefore I visited there, after examining the mobile I was told that since the mobile has been water damaged so warranty will not be covered and Rs 450 would be charged. It was also informed that if more that 450/- would be the repair cost then prior permission would be taken from me. Next day when I contacted service center, I was told to collect the mobile. After reaching there they told that it would cost Rs5500/- as repair cost of the mobile. I refused to give such huge amount and take back my mobile unrepaired. Once again I contacted flipkart for giving wrong address of service center and services I received and requested flipkart to collect my mobile for repair as it is there fault for giving wrong address. Flipkart refused to do so and gave me address of another service center. I did not expect from Flipkart for providing such bad service for their flagship product. I will definitely escalate the matter for their poor after sales services to customer. THIS IS MY LAST PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART. GOOD BYE",

I got a call from them and they asked me to install an app which will run few tests and show them my phone condition. I was asked to do a factory reset and told that if the issue is still persisting then we will accept the exchange. I accepted it and when I did a factory reset the phone the problem remains the same. This time when I requested an exchange. I got a call from the customer support and the guy who called me this time was awesome. HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME TO RUN A SINGLE APP AT A TIME AND ASKED ME TO CLOSE ALL OTHER BACKGROUND ACTIVITY. I was thunderstruck with his statement. I explained him that even my number-pad shows up after 5-10 seconds when I want to dial a number but he was not even listening to my statements. I also told him that I have used both the generations of moto G and I would know if something is wrong with the devices. At last he told me to go to Motorola service center and give a check there.If they are accepting that this phone has problem then FLIPKART WILL ACCEPT THE EXCHANGE. I have lost confidence on this site after this purchase.",

If you compare with any other companies, they all give assurance that mobile will be repaired within 5 days. How can we survive without a good mobile for 3 weeks if you do not have same kind of smart alternate mobile option..?? I tried to contact authority also, but no reply I have received... !! This is the most worst service I have seen in my life and I was thinking to buy MOTO G3 in exchange but rather going with MOTOROLA it is good to go with other company if company can not understand its responsibility to provide sufficient on-time service.",

I refused to take it and asked them to replace it , they replaced it again and sent me a new phone but this time the packing was worst then before, seal broken and then to cover it a fake seal had been put which was not neat at all , a 1st class kid would tape it better then them. I again refused to take the product and finally after a month of trauma they refunded my money. I am highly disappointed with Flipkart for such a shabby deal. They should have a check on their vendors and make sure their customer gets unused phones and not the replaced products. When I contacted Motorola they said if moto g product has more then one colored strip on the box that means it had already been replaced by some other buyer and in both the cases boxes had 3 and 4 strips respectively. Please be aware of such frauds as you will be spending your hard earned money and I bet, you will not like a replaced product delivered to you.Unfortunately there is no Zero rating.",

Assuming that the issues were caused by my usage habits, i bought a second moto G2, which worked well for 5 months following which the phone suddenly switched off and would not start again. This time however, i took it to a moto care centre where they want me to change the Logic board. which they themselves claim is hard to replace and will cost about 80% of the price of the phone. However, the phone is still under warranty but the moto care centre says the logic board is not covered under the warranty. I have been hearing rumors of Flipkart selling low quality and even used phones to customers. after being a loyal customer for such a long time. I am starting to consider believing the rumors. Absolutely disgusted by the after sales by motorola. I agree that the phone is very good, but that. is only if it actually works. The warranty is truly namesake, The right thing for you guys to do would be to replace my device. It doesn't seem to be much to ask for. Regards, Vishwajeet Suresh.",

I had bought a Moto G2 phone from you, that phone is not at a good make, I don't know if there is some manufacturing defect, it sometimes doesn't take signals, gets heat up, couldn't even play a nice game or watch a movie. I have tried to return that and again worst service. The website shows what is the progress what you are doing but guess what you guys are not actually not doing anything. I had tried to call so many times every time it's busy n busy and when you guys call you disconnect the call in 2 rings and when i ring back it doesn't connect. And finally today i get the message that it has been rejected. I now understood why people say don't buy from flipkart. I was so happy that I was getting a new phone and paid with cash. But, will never this to anyone.Now it's a waste phone. Best advice, never to online shopping, go to the store, see the phone, touch the product you want to buy and only then when you like it then buy it. Avoid Online Shopping.",

When i opened the pack the box contained only a replaceable screen guard with the tying other than that there was no screen guard his was not expected. Camera is exceptional the contrast and brightness is adjustable so not bad at all. takes practice to get some accurate stills. Sound is good pretty amazing and has good clarity, the ear buds provided in the box seem to do a fair job excellent for calls but not up to mark on music. so over all happie with the buy",

I got it for 8000 in exchange for my Micromax Doodle phone. BTW I have switched from my iPhone 5S and made this my Primary Phone as we all fought for Freedom long back and you are never free with an iPhone. In fact, in my opinion you pay apple a huge amount only to be enslaved by them. In this price range it is the best phone, in fact even people who have budget for 15K should by this one on the 3rd generation.",

And secondly about the phone, this is one of the amazing phone from Motorola, well versed with all the android features which would definitely enhance your smart phone usage experience. This phone comes preloaded with Lollipop version of android which lets you experience the rich features of all the Google products. The only thing i regret is, flipkart launched the Moto g3 version right after i bought Moto g2, \"Damn it!\". Never mind, i'm cherishing my moment with this new phone. Last but not the least, flipkart, keep on doing the good work. Thank you.",

            "comment": "I want to give 3.5/5 but thats not an option so 3 Its almost 4 months since I am using this phone. U can rely on my opinion though I am not an expert but an avid user of smartphones and a techno geek and have used mobile with almost all platforms Windows, Android and IOS. So heres the review for Moto G 2nd Gen - 1. Looks: Awesome. 2. Battery : Lasts only 12-14 hours with normal usage (whatsapp, games, internet surfing, etc) 3. Camera Rear: Very Good for outdoor photos with sufficient lighting, but not very good in dim light. The in-built camera app is superb, has manual focus, HDR, panorama. 4. Camera Front : Perfect for selfie (who needs 5MP for selfie this 2MP is enough) 5. Performance : LAGS A LOT. U load it with apps and it will start lagging. The 1GB RAM cant do much work I guess. Also I think its not the phone but the Lollipop Android OS which makes it slow. 6. Display : Superb. Amazing picture quality. Watch HD videos u will enjoy watching it on G2 7. Built : Very well built. U can always trust Motorola for its strong hardware (just like Nokia). It fall down twice or maybe thrice but this Corning Gorilla 3 with Scratch proof Glass is superb nothing happened not even a scratch. Conclusion : For normal mobile usage (girls and elders) G2 is the best smartphone in this price range, but if u are an avid user (tech savvy guys like me) then better go for Moto G 3rd Gen.",

I used the phone without a memory card for a week, it was slowing down but once I put in a 16 gig card it was all super fast and smooth. The phone still slows down a bit now and then maybe i need to empty cache and delete some pics. but a great phone, haven't tried the waterproofnees yes, but id recommend.",

Also it hangs for hours, even my mom is unable to restart it. Sometime the whole screen goes blank. Initially I told my mom that this may be some temporary issue and will be solved after restoring the phone to factory settings, but even after that the phone is kaput. I have raised a request for replacement of the phone. Its almost more than a week, but there is no progress. Initially some technical expert from Flipkart contacted and told that they will do the debugging and asked to install some software but after that nobody contacted, then someone from Flipkart called and told that they will be delivery a new phone and will take back the old one. Afterwards there's no progress, nobody is contacting us. This is really unprofessional behavior from Flipkart's end. I have bought so many phones earlier from Flipkart and there war no issue in delivery, but now when they have exchange the phone, they do not bother to contact the customer. This is really worst experience which I have faced while using e-commerce online service.",

I'd recommend looking for other options in the same price range, if you wish to use multiple applications simultaneously, since the phone starts to hang a bit. That is obvious with a 1GB RAM though. Otherwise the usage is pretty smooth with a decent look and feel. Go for it if you're looking for a budget phone with the latest version of Android and a good customer service response. Cheers!",

It hangs all the time & it does not recieve any signal, due to which the sim card needs to be removed & put back all the time. As the mother board crashed, all data, including songs & photos got erased. Unable to recieve calls!! Called flipkart and they cooly said that as the 30 day replacement period is over, nothing can be done about it. No help from their side! Bought it at Rs.12000/-. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, IT IS TOO OVERHYPED!!! Have a Samsung A7 & it is an awesome phone!!! Giving a 1 star as I have to give a rating. Otherwise is it zero!",

I may get a charger for Rs 400 from any local manufacturer (from the Flipkart web itself), but I feel cheated because I prefer to have a charger from the same Moto G, which generally cost more than 1000. And it is not even available to buy. I have been a frequent buyer from Flipkart, and now began to look for other online sellers.

Secondly,The Build quality of MOTO G is excellent,it looks like a premium quality phone when you see the initial impression Thirdly,It is a stock android phone which you would expect to get upgraded Android L(lollipop) Finally,Adding SD card slot which is a major upgrade observed in moto G2 Cons: 1.During the peak volume,the speakers produce a distorted noise 2.Slow charging & not happy with moto charger & avg head phones 3.Fast discharging(After Android L update) need to keep overnight charging & battery backup would be hardly from 22 hrs to 24 hrs. 4.over usage of Apps (esp Asphault 8 & other bloatware apps)causes too much heat at the back side of the phone. Considering overall aspects I would strongly suggest moto G if you are looking for a mid range budget android phones.",

Its robust and seems durable. Have already dropped it a few times, and have only noticed a slight scuff in the middle. This was the result of the phone falling face down on to the floor of an auto rickshaw. Yet the phone behaves as expected. It was slightly unresponsive from day one though, but this I attribute to the phones designs flaws and not an actual defficiency with the product sold.",

I have complaind regarding same on 29/03/2015 and have followed all the steps instructed and still my concern is not resolved. Now Flip kart expects me to visit a service centre which is not near by and they have clearly DENEID to take the product back or do a exchange or pay back when there is a issue in my mobile. So friends my question is why sholud i take a brand new mobile to a service centre to get the confirmation. Video posted is the proof. Still they are least bothered to resolve my concern where i never wanted a exchange but only to get my concern resolve and they have completely failed in doing so. Flip kart has made my days worse and disgusting and the customer support OMG they know only one line \"Please conctact service centre\". Is the producted delivered by Flip Kart to me is a fake one and thats the reason i guess they are denying. It can happen with you make your choices wisely.",

The phone hangs at times. Display goes off while switching between apps for a moment. There are some android specific bugs too, like the alerts don't open the app when the phone is being used. So you have to manually open the app. Same way when you get a call while using the phone, you get the notification on the top, but tapping on it doesn't do anything. I have to lock the screen, wait for the normal call reception view to come up and then receive the call. Also the phone hangs in the middle of continued usage. On the good side, battery consumption while talking to someone is very less, speakers are very loud and still clear, display quality is good and although the screen is broad, the phone is still very handy.",

Moto G2 camera is doing decent job video quality is perfect no one can get better in this price range. The only reason I'm giving 4 star is that cheap accessories Charger(Piece of shit take 4 hours to completely charge 2070mAH battery and worst thing is that if you're using phone while charging your phone won't get charged if you're using box charger WTF :x), Headphone worst quality I can better headphone is just INR200, and last there is no USB Cable in the BOX. NOTE (MUST READ): At the starting i was having battery issue like battery percentage was not accurate like battery percentage get stuck at 80% and remains to 80% for 2-3hours then suddenly drops to 51% ...also battery was draining quickly so i performed some tweaks to get better battery life ... 1. I cleared Cache Partition on my device 2. Calibrated Battery 3. Disabled Google Apps which are of no use. Now am getting 16-18hours battery backup. Cons: 1. Low Battery only 2070mAh for 5inch screen 2. 1GB RAM :( i need more 3. Low light camera performance",

I hope Motorola will give a better battery in future phone. The worst thing is they are not providing micro USB charging cable to charge it from laptop USB port and they do not have any recommendation to buy any 3rd party charger also. So, if you are normal user, you may go for it. But, if you are heavy user (wifi + dual sim + 2g/3g), never ever go for it (if they are giving free also do not go for it). My over all rating would be 3 star. Hello Motorola, please grow up....",

No wonder Moto has good features but it's always a risk to try it!! Would have given 5 stars if I didn't had to go through this.",

After loading about about 1.5 gb of apps and games, still the phone runs smoothly nd perfect. but some heavy 3d games, the phone heats up. its charger is really bad one. it takes 4 hours to charge fully, and if u r using simultaneously then it will charge at the same rate that u r using it. that means practically the battery will remain at constant level. Next compared to redmi note 4g, its better in only one way that is its dual-sim, but its the most wanted thing in now-a-days phones. the result of main camera is awsm. the vdo of 15 min will be of 1 gb, u can imagine the clearity. front camera of 2 mp is satisfactory. the main advntg is u can use multiple users and u get 8 gb intrnal memry for usage. sound in headphone is moderate. when its internal memory is below 100 mb, it will become slow which happens in all phones. finally for my usage, moto g 2 is better then redmi note 4g",

I noticed this when I was scrolling down on a webpage that has links. The scroll movement is often interpreted as a click by moto G2. I have moto E (1st gen). This never happens on moto E. moto E touch screen always works as per my request. moto G2 does so only half of the time. I wanted to return the phone but someone pointed that the replacement phones are refurbished ones.

There was a lot of cracking in the audio device, and the voice from the other side came with a scratching sound. ii. There was some component which was loose inside the phone, so much that it used to make a very distinct sound everytime i used the keypad. iii. The network would go off every 30 - 40 seconds into a call. I called up flipkart and they have replaced it within a week now. I received the phone today and till now it seems to be working fine except for a little scratching sound every now and then. I ill write another review after having used it for a week.",

No Lags Awesome 16 GB Memory Phone is very fast. Battery lasts 1 and a half Days on a normal usage (Wifi/Whatsapp/Calls) Screen and Camera Clarity is awesome and also has Video SlowMo feature. I am using my Galaxy S3 in Ear handsfree with this phone for music as the one provided with the phone is not great. A little Equalizer Tweaking and the Original Samsung In ear phones can give awesome clarity. (Use VLC Player from store which is free) Cons: No USB Cable provided (Reduced 1/2 star for this) Earphones are not at all great(Reduced 1/2 star for this) - I used this after using Samsung S3 and the beats and Bass is no way comparable.

Processor is also good snapdragon which is also used by samsung. The battery is good, but when using the internet the battery drains out quickly.

I went ahead to buy this phone despite of recent bad reviews and reviews about the new phones being the refurbished ones. The first this I checked was the manufacturing date which was March 2015 (I was satisfied with that.) Also, it has Android Lollipop as stock ROM installed. However, what follows is the true colors of this device in my first hand experience. Anyway, below are the details of my usage and problems I've been facing with this phone - I am using this phone with dual sim (that's why they have dual sim capability right?) 1. 100 to 0% battery drainage in less than 8-9 hours. (My samsung s advance with a swollen battery gives me at least 3-4 hours of backup) 2. Phone heats a lot whenever an app is running. 3. Charger burns metal hot whenever I am charging my phone. 4. A lot of apps keep crashing. 5. Speaker sound cracks on high volumes (shouldn't really be the case for a brand new phone.) Everything is clear now why flipkart is offering a huge discount of 3100Rs on a \"great in market\" device. Other than the above problems I haven't faced any issue yet. Right after posting this review, I am going to contact flipkart and ask for a replacement. Post that if I am not satisfied with the device, I am definitely asking for a refund. I hope it will help you in making a better buying decision. Based on my current and past experience, I definitely would ask users to buy new models and not go for stale models in the market. This is definitely a bad customer experience flipkart.",

After using this for a week, Here is my review about the mobile.. 1. Good build quality, Feels good and premium in hands, but little slippery. You might need some good back case. 2. Latest Lollipop update and stock android experience. I am lovin it.. In fact, everyone will love this experience. 3. HD screen has more saturation than any other phone in this price segment.. You won't get disappointed , Touchscreen has good response and buttery smooth.. 'THE BEST' 4. Battery backup - OK type... you can expect a full day battery backup with only calls, messaging and some time of whatsapp or other messenger... If you are a core-user, then you definitely need a second time of charging in a day. 5. RAM - 1GB is enough for average user but you will feel some lags then and there while playing high end games and using many apps(more than 6 or 7) at a time due to less clock speed of the processor (1.2 GHz) 6. Speakers - Good, Charging takes time to get full. 7. Overall experience : For average users and users looking for clarity of screen and android experience - \"BEST in this price segment\" For core users like users need a mobile for gaming - Please look for a mobile which has more than 1.5 GB of RAM... eg., Yu Yureka, Xiaomi etc 8. I am satisfied ... Worth for 10K according to my expectation.. Still it needs some improvement..",

Officially it was moto g2.But we can say it as room heater,iron box,water heater,suicide weapon..if we use 10 mints for call , camera , net , games ..etc it become a burned iron.so we should use wireless headset. not suitable for selfies in night.price is also high because of moto brand .. we can get min 5 to 15 percent discount on any smart phones in outside markets. eCommerce seller r selling on MRP prices. great battery capacity 2070.for extend battery life one trick is just select power off by understanding of Motorola suggestions thank to flipkart for fast delivery",

This is a very impressive mid range smartphone and it comes with android version lollipop 5.0.2 on the box.This is one of the few phones with the lollipop on the box. Packaging is very nice and accessories given in the box are also very handy. Performance of the phone is very good with battery life lasting a little more than a whole day (with complete services such as location, wifi, data etc being used ). The interface is so fluid and is a delight to use the phone. Camera quality is very good for daylight photography, however low light and night photos have a lot of noise and doesn't come out very great because of the flash not being bright enough. Also, disappointed with the fact that there is no mode selection in the camera such as portrait, sports etc. Call quality and video playback quality is very good. The battery does take a slightly longer than usual time to be fully charged, but as I said earlier, battery life is very good. USB OTG works very well, however with the support of a third party file manager app. Phone occasionally does hang when trying to retrieve old files etc. and sometimes has a problem to receive 3G/ Edge data signal. Display and sound quality is also amazing with the dual speakers. Packaging was excellent by Flipkart and delivered before time by seller WS Retail. Hats off to you guys!! Only wish there were more colours available, other than just black and white. Moto however does sell back panels and flip covers in various colours. Highly recommend this phone to a mid range user and kudos to Motorola Mobility.",

I am facing issues with the phone within 1.5 months of buying. It was not getting charged and was not switching on. The Moto service center people told me that there is a very minute edge in the charging pin that has been cut and needs to be replaced. But Moto does not replace the charging Pin alone, and the entire Motherboard needs to be replaced. the Cost is Rs.8000. This is not covered in warrenty because this issue is being considered as a physical damage. ( Not sure why this is so). 8000Rs for issue with the charging Pin alone. and the phone itself cost 12999. Totally Unhappy and the Flipkart is also non cooprative as the time has crossed 30 days from purchase. It's been more than 30 days since this issue started and have also called up Moto support , but no one seems to be assiting in resolving this. Totally unhappy with this product and service of Both Moto and flipkart.",

It gets so hot that you can't even touch it. 2. The phone, within 2 days of buying, STARTED GETTING HOT when on calls. I fail to understand how. 3. NO USB PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE PHONE. How am I supposed to connect my phone to the computer? 4. Untidy packing. Really bad. Please DO NOT buy this phone. I had alot of expectations with this phone but what's real is real. Thanks.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone when flipkart gave a discount through their app of Rs 2000. The phone was available for Rs 10999, and I bought a 6600 mAh power bank along with it. I have been using the phone for two days. I got this product one day before the expected date but the package through which flipkart sent it was not impressive. There was only sash of bubble wrap inside and that too was running everywhere except being attached to the packet of the phone. Thankfully the phone turned out to be okay so I guess I can deal with it. Body- Its very simple, yet has a premium look. The bezel around the screen is not the thinnest (Specially in the top, mainly to give room to the stereo speakers), yet the phone is surprisingly usable by one hand despite having a 5 inch screen. The back isn't glossy so no need to worry about fingerprints. However, sometimes the phone felt a little slippery and the volume rocker and the power button wobbles a bit. Its not like its going to come out anytime but it does. Motorola should have done better here. Screen- I have no idea how they managed to put such a good display inside a low budget phone like this. Yes, its not full HD (720p, not 1080) but believe me I have seen full HD screened phones giving a worse display performance. Ambient light sensor works like a charm. No matter where you go it adjusts the brightness for you perfectly. It has wide view angles and the screen is very much view-able at bright sunlight so no issues there. The touch responsiveness is good enough to be satisfied. I have no intention for a scratch test of the Gorilla Glass 3 that they provided but the feel was quite good. Unfortunately the day I got it there was a heavy rain while I was outside with the phone, It was in my pocket but the whole trouser got soaked, yet nothing happened with the phone so I would say the water resistant claim is valid too. Software and Performance- The phone comes with a Kitkat but for the very first time you switch it on, it will give you a prompt if you want to upgrade. If you select yes you can use lollipop from the very beginning. The overall operation is quite smooth but the phone does face a little lag while playing the transition animation from the apps menu while returning to the home screen. Though I think this is a problem of the software and can be fixed with an update. Loading of the casual games were really fast. Although while multitasking (maybe keeping 3 or 4 apps open at the same) I did face a little lag here and there for a short moment. I was playing Subway Surfers so it was not expected. Haven't played any heavy games yet, when I do I'll update the review. Camera- Motorola has a reputation that their phone cameras are not good. Well, the camera of moto G (2nd gen) is an exception. Its snapshots are very nice, even the front camera which is only 2MP can surprise you sometimes. It does struggle when the light is low but which camera doesn't, right? I thought it was good enough there too. Connectivity- The wifi and bluetooth had no problem and the performance was seamless. But While connecting through the USB I did face some issues. First of all, THE PACKAGE DOESN'T HAVE A USB CABLE INSIDE (What bad thing would have happened if they provided a charger with a removable data cable I wonder), so be ready to buy one along with the phone. Next, All of the data cables don't work on this phone. While buying choose a 4-wired data cable in stead of a two wired one (Can't write details here, space is limited). Battery- The battery backup is indeed low. It won't last a full day with moderate/heavy usage. Although to compensate that I bought a small 6600 mAh power bank so don't have that problem anymore. To summarize, the pros and Cons: Pros: Value for money Excellent Looks Beautiful Display Decent performance (Unless you load it up with 5-6 apps running simultaneously) Lollipop Upgrade Very good camera Cons: Video call not available (Can be done through third party apps like skype but not possible directly) No USB cable, sometimes data cable might mismatch and although charging, internal storage won't be shown in PC Headphone provided isn't good Speaker volume is not very high, sound quality good enough though Volume rocker and power button wobbles a bit, could have done better Battery Backup not decent (Will increase fairly once upgraded to lollipop) Takes long time to charge (Don't use your phone while charging, that will lessen it) The cons do have a way of compensation so to me, overall a fantastic phone, considering the budget. Going to give it 4 stars and would definitely recommend others to buy this when someone wants a brand with decent performance but has a problem with budget.",

I hope this problem is regarding this specific handset only. phone hangs a bit while playing high graphics games like Real racing 3, the suspect may be a RAM with capacity of 1GB, a 1.5GB or 2GB RAM would have done justice to this.",

Voice quality of phone is so bad, even on normal calling ppl around you can clearly listen your call. overall its a very low quality phone, ultimately I had to sell it at very low price.",

However one should buy this mobile only if you're sure that you have a service centre anywhere near your place. You may not have to make regular trips to the service centre, except if you're facing issues with battery and charging in general. 6 months after buying this mobile, it showed problems with charging. It wasnt getting charged. The flipkart people made it their responsibility to get the phone to work properly and deliver it to me again after servicing. Great job flipkart. The causes of my charging issues- not using motorola charger, draining the entire battery before putting in charge, overnight charging. Please avoid these mistakes if you wish any of your mobiles to work normally. This motorola model is great otherwise. Its a device for keeps.",

The performance was acceptable and all was well for 4-5 months. Accidently my charging slot happens to get damaged by me. What normal people will think its charging slot not a big issue. Easy replacement? No chance. The Motorola service Centre said that as charging slot is directly connected to the motherboard need to change whole motherboard. I was shocked!!!! And as charging slot damage is considered as Physical damage replacement of motherboard do not get counted in warranty period. The price they said to replace is 7k for 13k mobile (More than half of original). And I think most of the people don\u2019t know that charging slot damage affects that much amount. In Hindi it\u2019s like \u201cGhode (Horse) ki naal (horse shoe) kharab ho gayi toh pura ghoda hi badal (replace) daalo\u201d. Other customers, I suggest you, to think before purchase. Don\u2019t make a mistake that I made. I have decided to throw the phone and get another one (Not Moto). Why? Coz I know at least other phone charging slots does not charge this much amount. So here's me saying Hi and Goodbye to the only Moto product I will ever own.",

On 26th (27 is expected date promised by flipkart) still status was same so I called its customer care services and escalated. Today (30 March ) finally i received my phone. I wanted to ask the reason behind this poor delivery . If any product is out of stock please dont promise us and that too in case of phone(one week i was without any communication with outer world).

On the 31st day from date of receipt my cell was facing touch screen issues. The touch screen started getting hanged automatically and i had to wait for around 10 odd minutes for it to work in the normal condition. Sometimes it used to get hanged in such a way that i just could not use my cell phone for couple of hours.Since it was the 31st day hence i approached flipkart and asked for a replacement but they told we cannot replace it since it was the 31st day as per their Policy. Day 1 : . Finally ,as per flipkart , on 3rd March, as my cellphone was in warranty period and as I trusted after sales services of Motorola I thought to give it to authorized service center near to my location. So I approached service center of Motorola in Mumbai (Address : B2X Service Centre , Dadar, Mumbai). I gave my phone to the counter and they said that \" the touch screen and display will be changed and it will take 10 days\". Day 18 : I tried calling the service centre several times but no one picked up the call the emails sent to the service centre went unanswered.Hence finally i called up motorola customer care and i was being told that the cell phone is ready for pick up.Hence i went all the way to the service centre and to my surprise i was being told that the cell phone has not beinf repaired and will take 3 more days. Day 20 : Finally i called up motorola , marked a mail to the customer care id on 23rd March 2015 ,regarding the delay. You can check ur email records in the system.I was being told to wait for one week Today Day 25 : I am really disappointed its just been 2 months i have taken a motorola phone out of which one month its i could not use it and it is with the service centre. I have just wasted one full month due to motorola's bad customer sales service. My question is what is the use of writing in big word \"12 MONTHS WARRANTY\". What if I say, that Motorola cell phones are losing their quality and using cheap equipments and finally Flipkart losing out their brand and their policy. Seems like I am stupid and visited the authorized service center. Does it take 20 days or more just to replace a part ???? I expect Flipkart to keep up their reputation and trust by replacing the defective piece as it comes fully under 100% warranty. Flipkart...plzz wake up ???",

It does give around 9-10 hours of usage using wifi. I guess that is enough for me. 3. Smooth, fast and clean UI. No additional tags or apps. Loved it. 4. Good camera quality. I loved the camera quality, especially the back cam which gives outstanding picture quality in ambient light conditions. 5. The dual front speakers are really a gift. I could now play songs and not worry to keep the phone screen facing the table. Cons: 1. Could have had a better headphone with the device as the default one doesnot have much effect. 2. Charging using the default charger is something that I wish I wouldnt have to do, as it takes upto 4hrs to charge from 0% to 100%",

Pros: Outstanding Camera Better battery-Lasts for at least a day while using internet. Display-Awesome 5 inch HD Cons: THE RAM! struggles a bit while using- occasionally when i reached 60 apps Gaming- Not the best That's it for now! Best phone for normal day to day use if you are not a gamer!",

So i was waiting for it. but it doesn't come. so i tracked it on site this time they are showing delivery unsuccessful. this is totally ridicules. If you are not able to deliver it then why you send sms??? Flipkart has lost all its credibility as fast delivery. They are overbooking on orders without taking care of deliveries.",

Other than that, no worries. Have purchased the PNY 10400mAH power bank for this mobile. Charges my mobile atleast 4 times and that too very fast! Also, got the sandisk 32GB class 10 microsd card.

I have come from a Nexus 4 and it is and upgrade in some aspects while a slight downgrade in others. So starting my review: PROS -Dual Speakers: Super, lovely heavenly sound(As compared to the Nexus 4) -Camera: On par with the Nexus 5! -Great screen size( It didn't take me long to get used to it, and once I did I'm now a fan) -High build quality: Really, coming from a N4 I'd definitely pick this quality, sturdy, feels great in the hand. -Battery life: Gives me approximately an hour more of screen on time as compared to the nexus 4, overall I'd say a 20% improvement(lasts a day easily with medium to heavy use) -SDCard: HUGE proponent for buying the Moto G2. -After market support: Several ROMs available. -OTG Support: Plug in USBs, mouses, keyboards, gamepads. CONS 1. RAM: Felt that the ram(1GB) was a bit low for a new device, however there is no compromise on the performance.(There is, however memory leak which is to be supposedly fixed in the 5.1 update) 2. Non-removable battery: I'd always like the option to pop a new battery in :P 4 and a half stars! So I guess that's it, the pros to con ratio is in favor of buying the Moto G(2nd gen) :D Hoped this review helped!",

The smartphone sports a large display which enhances the experience to watch video. Also you get free Lollipop update for moto g2. The only thing I feel is, it should have at least 2 GB RAM. Currently supported RAM is fabulous while using a couple of apps at a time, however, if you wish to use multiple heavy apps, this device under performs. Sometimes due to overload, the apps are forcefully closed automatically, which is annoying.",

If the seller is WS retail than products are 100% genuine but if you are buying from any other retailers you may need to het in touch with the service center to confirm whether its a registered product with the company or not.As there are too many fraudulent activities happening in the market of smart phones these daya.. I had been using Moto e for last 8 months recently upgraded to Moto G2...I love this phone as it has got almoset everything you need.. 1 thing I would like to mention here what I experienced with this phone is.. When you upgrade it to 5.0 you may feel a leg in opening apps and may feel that device is running slow.. All u need to do is to back up your phone and than do factory data reset... Now when your phone is up you ll notice that the processing speed is just doubled up. And it will work absolutely fine.. Other thing tht moto should upgrade in this phone is to provide battery and charger of higer ratings as the charger takes hell lot of time to finish chargin and 2070 mah battery is insufficient for a smart phone like this. Phone has good audio quality but headphones are pathetic.. It gives a feeling of headphones in 2001-2005.",

Camera is just awesome and the audio quality is also very good. Sometimes it hangs but i think that is bcoz of installation of too many apps. So, in short, go for this and it is a best budget phone under 15k.",

Almost all the games are promisingly good.Build is also quite solid.And the best part is that you can use this phone single handedly.

            "comment": "I bought this phone last December and it left me with great impact. But unfortunately last week my mobile was pick-pocketed in the market. Now I'm back to square again. I started to search online again and thought to try my hands on a similar kind of product but not this again. But every time I compare this phone, to name a few, HTC 620G DS, Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo, even Grand 2 etc.. I was surprised to notice that this phone has got far superior quality in all aspect! It has got Cornila glass 3 (I hate plastic covered screen) Pictures are good, video is outstanding, sound quality is perfect with dual speaker, body cover is unique and not slippery, battery is decent it works through out a day. Most impressive part is it does not get heat when you video call over Skype, I do that for more than an hour and it is as cool as it looks which also surpasses all the expensive featured phones. All games are suitable, no lagging. And lets not forget it has got a latest Android L which gives you a feeling of being a step ahead than the rest. The only problem is that it takes longer time to get charged in original charger but that's negotiable... Guess what?? I've already ordered this phone again and it should be delivered within a few days!!",

This time they rejected the request to refund /replacement second time, since thier technical executive concluded that phone is working fine as per thier troubleshooting. You will be left disappointed as these days flipkart customer care services have become pathetic. They will play around with you for sometime and have thier customer care call you back with same responses all over. You write all kinds of mails complaining about the product and they write same non sense all over. They are really turning to be unreliable. Please be careful while purchasing products like these if luck is never on your side. I have decided to not pursue any other product on thier website post the blunt responses they have given. Wish you good luck !! =========================================================== Battery issue within 3 days of use ( First review) All other reviews suggest this phone is good. the look and feel is great and so many features look nice. SAR value can be of concern but for me, the Battery has caused problems. Just bought the phone last week and its not been a week since use, the battery begins to drain at faster pace. The battery indication shows 100% on full charge in morning, 70 % post 3 hours with the phone used just for calls . When the phone is kept completely idle with no application running, no 3G-Wi-Fi, GPS ON etc. the battery still drains at the rate of 1% every 1-2 minutes. But for a moment it suddenly drained 5 % in one short. this is really puzzling and on direct communication with Motorola assist team, they say to do cache-wipe and factory reset to see if battery is resolved. thats not advisable since there is data loss. I can anticipate this issue to be there in future and guidance given by Motorola customer care is also funny. I am in attempt to see if there is any service center who can help, yet with past experiences I can say they will come up with same response as what Motorola did. Honestly the phone looks good but battery is really a turn-off. I hope the Flipkart authorities inspect thier inventory correctly to see all products are tried and tested before selling off. I hope a replacement fetches a good piece.",

Battery is decent and runs for nearly 12-14 hours with average use. Automatic brightness adjustment indoor and outdoor. Best camera at day light condition. Real protection by corning Gorilla Glass. Happy playing Subway surfers, Temple Run 2 and Hill climb racing. Good customer care service. Cons: Ram is 1 gb which sometimes may give feeling of lag. Earphones provided are too bad as no sound proof. Full charging takes a bit long time. Main camera does not click good pictures at night. Price is bit too high as competitors with same specifications is available in market within 10k. As a customer: I am happy and satisfied with my phone.",

I am a office person with lots of downloads and had to buy another 8 GB memory card Also, its front camera is OK at day time, at night time pixels of selfie gets scattered ( just as of 0.2 mp camera), so front camera sucks. Rear is good for 8 mp. Lots of updates, so u get to use proper software at real time. So friends best of luck while taking decision for smart phones",

When i contacted Flipkart they wants me to contact Motorola Service Centre day after delivering me a faulty product they want me to roam around the service centre which is not at all fair From day one after buying this phone i am having hell a lot of issues. Request you not to buy this phone. It is not worth for money and not worth to buy online a faulty product.",

It has a decent processor, good display and an average camera. But battery life leaves much to be desired; gets drained a little early than you would expect. Still can stand one day with pretty good use. Anyways Kudos to Moto and Flipkart for making this moto boy budget friendly in India.",

Much like my good old Moto Defy :-) - 1GB RAM is actually not sufficient while playing high-end games. Otherwise it's doing a great job. No lag whatsoever. - The backcover is pretty cool and the overall product design and feel is very good. The Build quality is great too. So other than the 1gb ram and the not so good rear cam this phone wins hands down. Loving the MOTO G2 ! !",

I was One of the first few customers to receive this handset. Thank you so much Flipkart. I am using this phone for around 4 months.. here is what i found after usage Pros:- >Superb screen size >Camera quality is far good compared to many phones in this budget. >Android 5.0 runs smoothly without any lags. >Speaker is good, no cranky noise even if u increase the volume. >It handles 720p and slow 720p shots extremely well. > Expandable memory and inbuilt memory are a charm. Cons:- >Battery backup is the main issue P.S- get ur self a portable charger if ur a avid music listener, gamer etc. (battery backup is only for 7-8 hts wid heavy usage) >A little heating on the back while running too many applications. > Eats up quite a lot of ram sometimes. Conclusion- A very good, descent phone with good specs. I dont have too much of a problem only if the battery thing would be solved, the phone would be the best. Running 5.0 lollipop smoothly in it without any issues. Memory bug which was present has been taken care of. Apps can be moved to SD card. Supports OTG. Overall Experience with the phone is amazing. To be honest every phone does have some pros as well as flaws, but compared to other phones, this is one o the best i feel. P.S- Dont hurry to update to lollipop as still its developing and has a quite few bugs. Use kitkat 4.4 till a good stable version is released.",

It's not more that 10 days i.e. still 30 days replacement guarantee is there under FLIPKART ADVANTAGE thing.

I went to a trip and did not carried a camera as I was satisfied with picture quality of this camera. Before this trip, I have used camera occasionally, that too for not more than couple of pictures at a time. On my trip as I was using phone's camera, just after 3-5 minutes of continuous usage (especially in bright sunlight), it stopped responding and my phone went to hung state (even power button was not responding). I left it as is for couple of minutes, after which it camera did not worked but phone became sluggish. During this time, phone battery started draining at a faster rate. I was able to use it again after about 5-10 minutes, but faced same problem after couple of minutes. After coming home, I did a factory reset and hoped that this problem will be solved. Few days later, I needed to record a live event. Before starting recording, phone's battery was at 60%. After about 15-20 minutes of recording, again the sluggishness and unresponsiveness appeared, soon after which complete battery drained. Other than above, no major issues.",

Excellent form structure makes it easy to hold and operate. 2. Build quality is pretty impressive and even after six months the device feels like new. 3. Absolutely No Heating Issue, even after extensive usage like playing games/ watching videos etc. 4. Battery Life: With Normal usage the battery easily last a complete day. 5. Lollipop update has simply transformed the user experience. 6. Speaker Quality along with call quality is very good. The Neutrals: 1. Camera quality is pretty decent and captures good pics during daylight, however there are not many functions to play around with the inbuilt camera app. 2. Screen brightness and Colour reproductions are satisfactory but definitely not the best. The Negatives: 1. Evident Cost Cutting thankfully with accessories only: Pathetic Headphones along with pathetic charger (No USB data cable provided). Summary: Overall I'm pretty happy with my Moto G 2nd Gen and even after six months thanks to the Lollipop update the device still can hold its own infront of newer phones from Xiaomi, Lenovo, Micromax and all.",

            "comment": "I have purchased this product from Flipkart. I appreciate flipkart for very fast delivery. I got this device with android 4.4.4(Kitkat). It was working good till I did not updated it in new android Lollipop(5.0.2). After update I started facing the issue of audio not coming from the call speaker during calls but my voice is going perfectly to other side. When I reboot the phone it started working fine but the same thing was happening again and again. So I request a return from flipkart. They asked me to do some trouble-shooting and reset the phone to factory setting (OS did not reset during this ). But after trouble-shooting I kept facing the same issue and need to reboot the device again and again. I requested a return again. This time flipkart guys installed Smart-Check application to it to find the issue if it is real and I am not making it up. That subdue application was unable find that issue as I have rebooted the device already and this issue of voice not coming was not happening every time. FLIPKART AGAIN REFUSED THE RETURN. As they replied that their application was unable to detect any issue although I keep telling them that this issue does not happened every time and your this application is not able to detect this issue at this point of time. They replied \"We cannot sure about this kind of issue as we are not the manufacturer. but we are sure about the thing that smart check did not show anything but we cannot assure that smart check are perfectly designed to detect the issue. I again requested the return as I was facing the same problem. This time somehow they were persuaded (by fear or courtesy I cannot say) ,they accepted my return and delivered a new Handset with ANDROID 5.0.2 well before the given time frame. Now I am again facing the same issue and again need to request the return. I have done all the troubleshooting which flipkart earlier stated me. Even I have done the troubleshooting which Motorola told me but still facing the same issue and there is no fix for the problem. I am still wondering what to do with this handset. I am not going to buy any motorola product in future. Latest Update: I requested a return on 18th Mar 2015. I got a call the next day 19th Mar at 2:30 pm from a lady from esclation deprtment stating that THEY WILL REPLACE THIS PRODUCT WITH A NEW ONE AND IF THAT PRODUCT WILL HAVE PROBLEM THEY WILL REFUND IT. I CONFIRMED THE SAME FROM HER THRICE But here is the height of the cheating from flipkart, They call me up the same day at 5:23 pm telling me that they cannot replace it. the max they can do that is to arrange a technician. I tried to explain the entire issue to that guy but that guy was not even ready to understand and told me the earlier information that given to you about replacement is WRONG INFORMATION DELIBERATELY PROVIDED TO YOU AND THEY CHANGED THEIR POLICY FOR THIS PHONE TO REPLACE IT ONCE WITH A FAULTY PRODUCT. NOW YOU ARE YOU OWN AND FLIPKART DON'T BEAR ANY RESPONSIBILITY. I requested that guy to let me talk with any other more senior guy and he replied he is the most senior person in flipkart and no other senior are there. They forcefully arranged a Motorola technician and refused to believe me that phone is faulty. On 20th March The technician visited and declared that problem is unsolvable. and this is a true fail case and recommended replacement but FLIPKART DON'T BLINK YET. Now I really can't say what abt my money which I paid flipkart and what abt their commitment for customer satisfaction and 30 days hassle free replacement and What to do with this phone. I am even not able to perform basic function that is calling. Finally on 25th March, Refunded me my money. Thank you Flipkart for your services",

The touch was satisfactory and overall it was all fine until ten days back - I realized that I couldn't switch on the phone after trying several times. That was the beginning of my misery with this phone. I called up the flipkart helpline to know about motorola service centers. I was wrongly guided with an address that doesn't exist. A day after I managed to find the correct address. I approached the center - 25 km away from my place of residence. What lay in store for me was a horrifying reality - I had to pay 80 percent of the total cost to get my 'battery jack' fixed. Motorola is an unethical manufacturer apparently. It's flipkart's responsibility too to settle consumer grievances - this is a case of counterfeiting on part of both the manufacturer and retailer!",

Phone charge about 3 to 4(maximum) with data ON... 2.Its getting hot but not much. 3.Simple games like temple run Oz, subway surfer, are stuck most of the time. So guys think twice before choosing this phone. there are other brands also out there which u can opt with low price better than this one.

They tend to make you wait about more than a month and then also do not resolve your problem completely.As u can see in my case , i reported these issues to the Motorola service center(SAI COMMUNICATIONS , GHAZIABAD) and then i submitted my phone there with these problems that i mentioned before.They took my phone for more than a month and then only replaced the display and leave out the other problems. In addition to this they damaged my phone physically and want to charge me for that as physical damage don't count in warranty. So as a reviewer i will suggest you not to buy Motorola phones as they have horrible after sales service but if this does not matter to you then you can do whatever you want.",

Although No multicolored LED only simple plain white LED,also No IR blaster that makes this phone feel like incomplete but compared to the price it is set this is a very great phone so as to with all the best features!! Pros: #OTG support #Pure Lollipop with multiusers!! #At least a white LED. Cons: #No Ir blaster!!! #Not sensors like GALAXY S4 or S5 but acceptable (considering cost)! #No multicolored LED. #Not much RAM (minimum 2Gb is basic now!!",

RAM usage goes too high frequently leading too crashing of applications. I own a micromax android one can A1 and I can say it performs much better and faster that this. May be due to Kitkat but it is much better than this. Motorola's claim of 1 day battery is also not true. By the end of evening you have to reach the the switch board to get it charge. Also the retailer WS retail is not good. They have sent me a substandard product. It has got some visible damage marks on the screen! My only recommendations is not to go for this product better buy another one! May be much cheaper than this",

Towards end of January, I started getting popups for andriod OS upgrade to lollipop. I ignored for a while, but bit the bullet on Feb 12th. Upgrade was easy. HOWEVER, the battery wouldn't charge after the upgrade. I tried couple of steps the Motorola Live Center advised, but those didn't work. Then I was advised to take it to the nearest service center. The service diagnosed the device, and told me that the mother board of the phone was fried! The phone is under warranty, but they didn't have parts in stock. Apparently they have to \"indent\" for the part from the company. Fast forward to March 17th, after repeated calls and an email to both Motorola help line and also the service center, I have yet to hear if the phone is repaired. Apparently, Motorola doesn't have any parts in stock in India, and they have to arrive from China. Terrible.",

It's much faster, the screen size and resolution is good. Easy to get used to and transferring all data using the Motorola Assist is an absolutely fantastic option. The camera is reasonable and is a little cumbersome to use. All in all, a good phone for your mother.",

None the less I have put a scratch guard. The gorilla glass felt better whatsoever. Ram: (1GB) Suffices; Most of the time its 50 % used. What disheartens me is any time it reaches around 70-75% usage, the cell slows down. Don't know if it is to be expected out of a Quadcore Processor. I didn't expect that to happen before 90%. You need to have Clean master to keep the cell smooth. [I do use Clash of Clans and Brain Wars quite frequently but still no app > 100 MB ] Battery is really good so far. Its been only a month's use but 90% battery lasts me for more than a day. [Use involves frequent Clash of Clans and Brain Wars use once every 2 hours for 16 hours of the day] I had a Micromax A116 which I bought 2 years back for 15k and the only advantage I feel is the additional 16 GB internal for 2k lesser value. (I am very performance of Cell oriented person and don't focus much on camera). 1 GB Ram and quadcore snappdragon, have not been as good as I thought them to be before purchase. The back cover \"seems\" a little fragile. I am planning to get a rigid back cover over the existing one. Though I would say it is a quite trustworthy Cell in this price range and at these specs.",

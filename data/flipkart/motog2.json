I am even more worried and irate by the time taken for service, Its been said that the service will take at least 15 working days as spare parts are not readily available. I am also not been given proper feedback as for the reason as to why there is a problem with the motherboard and I am worried if the repaired hand set will meet my exceptions in future. Would appreciate if I could get a assurance from Moto team that the repaired hand set will not have any problem and if you would arrange for the parts asap.

I would not suggest anybody to buy this phone, you better throw your monry, instead of buying this phone. Charging time is 6 hour and discharging is less than that. What is the use of phone, if it is not ON. This phone sound is worst than any phone I have used. 1300 rupee phone has better sound than 13000(this) phone. I request you not to buy this phone. India already has a lot of poverty, please help some needy with your money, instead of buying this chinese crap. Plz plz plz plz plz Don't buy this phone... Don't even try to test buy yourself.",

            "comment": "I had a moto g 1st generation which was a very good phone apart from its multitasking ability. Because of its 1 gb ram and not so great RAM management, it was very aggressive in killing the background applications. Sometimes it used to happen that I am making some payment through the chrome browser and when I switch to messaging app to see the OTP password and then switch back to Chrome, the payment page used to get refreshed and the whole thing had to be repeated again. It was frustrating. Recently I had bought Moto G 2nd generation and the same multitasking problem is present in this phone as well (as the RAM and RAM management is same as the 1st generation). Another major issue I have found with 2nd generation which was not present in the earlier version is its battery life. The phone drains quite a lot of battery power even when it is idle. On checking which apps are draining the battery, I found that Cell Standby is taking lot of juice out of it (next to Screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer). So when you take your phone in the morning you will find that the battery is several notches down from what you left it in the night.This drainage issue was not there in the 1st gen. I think, there is some software issue related to this and if Motorola is listening (as it has been highlighted by many users in the official Motorola forums) then it should be rectified in the next software update. All said and done, the phone can still manage to get you through a normal day of usage. So all in all, Moto G 2nd gen still remains the best phone to buy in this budget with some issues related to multitasking ability and battery life. No other complaints till now even after using the Moto G for more than 10 months (1st and 2nd gen combined)",

Note: Asus Zenfone 5 is already gave Gift to My wife. So I am user of both Mobs. Review now: Pro Vs Zen 5 Vs Lumia 730: ================== 1. Handy Mob while Comparing to zenfone 5. zen 5 is bigger & quiet tough to chat. 2. Cam is better then Zen 5 when we use Flash. Zen 5 will give dull white shaded while flash. 3.Sound is crispy & good in Moto G2. 4.OTG is given . So we can use External USB for seeing movies. not in Lumia. 5.Windows Apps are not fast & not Better UI. When we see Fb messenger, Naukri etc 6.Caller Voice is Sleek & Accurate. Zen 5 has issues. It cant be heard when we travel in train or Bus. Cons: ==== 1. Charging Take nearly 1: 15 hours to get completed. This is the problem in all the Android. Lumia 730 is fast 2. Net Speed is not fast when we use 2G Monthly Data Packs when compared to Lumia. But without any good Apps UI, fast cant be benefit to you in windows. 3.No separate USB Cable. Note: ==== Review is based on 1 week usage of Moto g2 & 6 months usage of Zen 5 & 1 yr usage of Lumia (520).",

Asphalt 8 crashed few times, but hey not every time.It is strange that 1 gb is not enough for android phones. Not a good multitask mobile. Battery life is not good(6-8 hrs max). Disable Location to save battery is quite a annoying thing in every Android phones. Takes more time to charge. U have to spend little more money to purchase 1 mah charger. Basically stock android , sometimes I feel am I using Micromax series mobile. Performance is below par. Touch sensitivity is not great. No 3rd party theme work good on it .Better to use stock android itself. Go for Zenfone if u need classic look smooth UI. I think in coming days even 3 gb RAM might not be enough for android phone. Strange it is. Final words: Below 15k this is ok.for starters since it is from Google ,android OS updates for sure.Buy Power bank along with this phone.People who look for performance based this is not the mobile for you.",

Here comes Moto G (first incarnation) which changed the perception of smart phones in terms of value offering at competitive prices. About Moto G (2nd Gen) It is a well balanced phone with 5\" screen and stock Android OS, latter helps the user get the best of each new OS that Android launches (at times with its share of bugs as well..), this is something Samsung users can only dream after paying 3 times the money. 1 GB RAM does much more than actually required and thanks to stock OS, it works ore efficiently. Camera 8MP does its job extremely well in day light and with HDR mode defaulted, you can be guaranteed with good pictures. Its equally poor at dusk and low light conditions. Build quality is very sturdy with metal frame body giving it a tough feel. Cons: a) Feels slightly bulky when compared with other phones but no deal breaker b) Curved back panel makes it little inconvenient while using. Extra back cover solves the issue c) Charger & ear phones are massive disappointments. Charging cable is not detachable and hence one needs a separate cable to connect the device with laptop. Flipkart keeps continuing its great show of rapid quick delivery and customer focused service. Got a good deal at INR 9000 after exchanging my good old BB Curve 9300.",

This review is particular to the unit I have got from Flipkart. Firstly, I am completely dissapointed with the quality of the latest lot of Moto G2's that are being sold. I purchased this devices on 14th Dec 14 and the issues that I am facing with the product are: 1. There is a slight dent on the left hand side of the phone from day one. Immediately bought a cover from Flipkart itself and started using the same. 2. Phone started lagging a lot and I reset the phone. Still occasional lags can be seen. 3. Battery sucks big time on this particular device. Have to charge atleast 3 times a day with only mail and call usage. My previous Moto G's (have had 3 before) gave me a day's battery life. 4. Occasional heating of the phone. 5. Display quality is worse than previous Moto G 2014's. I had raised a replacement request with Flipkart on 19th Dec 14 and they assured they will call me on 19th Dec itself. No call but I received SMS that they tried reaching me. All lies. I was in network full day and didn't receive any calls. A call to customer care has assured me of a call today. No calls yet. Bad service FLIPKART to your Flipkart First Subscriber. Check my records and you will find my shopping history with you. Hence, think twice before you purchase this device, specially the new lot. Check for dents on the metal part right at the beginning. Update: FlipKart called up and did what was needful. Thanks FLIPKART!!!",

When iam in roaming my Moto G Gen 2 was not taking my home network, instead it is taking other network eventhough my home network is stronger equal to the one selected automatically.. Sometime my moto g wont take any network .. Useless Product may be my piece is useless,, In short good stuff with poor battery....",

It feels comfortable holding in one hand , the only 2 cons i have found is 1 gb of RAM n not so great Battery Back up thats all about the review my advice is u to all purchase phones within 15 k, i bought samsung S3 for 36 k still in jellybean lots of Bugs almost trashed my phone away,after 1 yr now at the half price i get similar specs n a better phone n quicker updates, i change my phone for every year coz i only invest upto 15k At last i hope u guys find this Review Helpful :-)",

Pros: 1 Attractive simple design of typical Moto. 2 Awesome gaming experience with no hang no lag no matter how heavy game you play on it. 3 294ppi makes the display very very nice . believe me it very fine and clear. 4 The video recordings are very clear and descriptive. 5 very handy and looks awesome on hands. 6 good processor speed. you can use as many app you can and won't get hanged. 7 The stereo speakers are so good amazing sound. Cons: 1 The camera is not so 8mp as it give the same quality image as my samsung wave's 5mp camera gives. 2 the battery won't stand up for 4-5 hours but its ok as i am using my phone every minute.but the phone exhausts 1% of battery every 3-4 minute. 3. phone gets heatup almost to 45-50 degrees Celsius if you use it for long on heavy games. 4 sometimes the touch act differently but it happens very rear. Believe me Overall it's a very very amazing phone with this price range.I am really very happy and waiting for the android update of Lolipop. And in the end i really thankful to Flipkart for fast delivery.",

Guys what a fantastic service by flipkart....Its almost a 15th product which I purchased from flipkart...but still a perfect service...hats off guys(flipkart team)... Pros: Now moving back to Moto G2 ...(read specs on website) 1.Sleek design.. 2.even though bigger in size very easy to hold....(5\" and still perfect) 3.camera outstanding...guys click shots during nights and you will amazed to see clarity and flash actually works superb... 4.smooth processor.... 5.pls note even though it has 1 Gb RAM...but it will still beat higher RAM phones as it has snapdragon 1.2 GHz quad core processor... 6.touch is sexy!!!! Cons: 1.Android kit kat 4.4.4 used but still it lags some shortcuts...like data on - off,battery % is not there but for time being its annoying... (THOUGH MOTOROLA KEPT BASIC ANDROID EXPERIENCE ...NOT ALTERED...FUTURE CHANGES IN OS WILL BE EASY TO UPGRADE)... 2.though stereo speaker but at higher volume sound is cracking....you cant get clear loud sound... 3.headphone sound is poor... but for my usage i feel better to use.....So I will give 8.5/10......",

I have observed the following things and thought my review would be helpful to fellow mates. I am not at all convinced with this phone. I have used Android phones from other vendors before I bought Moto G 2nd gen. Pros: 1. It is from Motorola. 2. Look and Feel is okay okay. Cons: So many cons are there and i am putting down few main cons. 1. Network drops frequently for no reason. 2. Battery drains with in no time compared to other phones which i have used. It takes lot of time to recharge. 3. Switch to vibration mode and then come back normal profile. After few minutes / seconds, it goes back to Vibrate mode automatically. 4. You cannot delete selective messages in a specific conversation. I had this feature in a different mobile which i bought three years back. 5. You cannot delete all the contacts in one go. :((((( that's horrible. I didn't see the feature. 6. It doesn't provide File Manager. You have to depend on external apps from Android. and the list goes on.",

However, the motherboard to the new phone crashed within 1 and half month of receipt of the replaced phone rendering me handicap and phoneless.. Thereafter, I requested flipkart guys to replace the phone as I have never heard of the incident that a motherboard crashing of a brand new phone. After writing several emails to flipkart, they finally decided to reply to my email saying they will revert in 2 days which needless to say they conveniently slip the deadline and did not revert.And on being inquired again they only repeatedly gave me the option of taking my phone to he service centre and that they cannot offer me any more assistance than this very curtly put across to me. Worst is my phone is now lying with the service centre for more than 10 days and every time i visit them they tell me that they will take 2 more working days as they do not have the required part and the same has to be imported from USA. There are nearly 6 service centres in Mumbai with none possessing the required part. Because of he whole fraud committed by this platform which encourages vendors to sell defective phones I am rendered handicap without a phone and regretful of my idea of buying a phone online from this website ... It is therefore requested to everyone out there to not buy Moto G 2nd generation for we Indians who believe in good quality phones would not appreciate such major hurdles and issues in the phone within just 1 and half months of receipt precisely. DO not even deserve one star but had to hit on the rating star as it was mandatory I have experienced the issues which any person would face at the rear end of a phone's life ... It is really disappointing to purchase goods from this website because even though I have paid the money for a brand new phone I have received a defective piece... The shopping experience on flipkart has really been a sour one... I feel cheated..",

About Moto G 2nd gen which is used for 2months now - Advantages - Camera - Its really awesome guys, the clarity is so great its more better than the samsung grand 2's 8 MP which I compared with my friend so nowadays he asks me to take a pic from Moto G 2 though he has grand 2 ;) Internal Memory - Oh its super cool which gives 16GB and its more than sufficient. Processor - Moto G 2 is really fast guys. Trust me it is or check Moto G 2 Vs. iPhone 6 Video in Youtube(Moto G 2 is fast as per that video). Great for games. Screen - its a 5\" screen and its so clear when it comes to camera or videos. Its great to see a video or play games. Sim - Dual Sim works fine, also with 3G(for 1st sim only) and 2G. (2nd sim doesn't support 3G). Speakers - Its really loud. The person next to you can hear what the person at the other end of the call is speaking with you if the volume is 100% so check your phone volumes or check if any person is next to you ;) Inbuilt Apps - we can move apps to SD card or delete which is not required except few google apps. Good to handle, cant expect a better phone for this price. Disadvantages - which we can see normally in other smartphones as well Battery - this is also cool I use the wifi or internet almost 18hours a day and battery lasts for 1 day, I would suggest you guys to download the battery doctor app which helps a bit. Initially it was draining out bit fast but after 3-5 days it got adjusted and it lasts for a day. please judge on the battery after 3-5 days of your buying. Heating problems - I do not see any such issues, charger was getting heated up initially but now I do not see such problems and never faced this with the phone. I was confused if I should buy a Moto G 2 or Micromax canvas Nitro. But I am really happy with Moto G 2 its so cool. everyone who sees it asks for it ;) If you confused which one to buy I would say go for Moto G 2nd Gen. Anytime google phone rocks.",

No separate ringtone/profiles can be set. Number dialing is a two step process, dial > press call > select sim. 3. Average camera ( Horrible in low light) Battery lasts a day for me, not more. About 30% left at the end of day. I use 2G all the time and wifi while at home. 2-3 hrs screen on time.",

Stock Android 2. Promised Lollipop upgrade 3. Price PROS 1. Decent battery life of 24+ hours with 3.5+ hours of on-screen time. (will get better with Lollipop upgrade) 2. Build quality is excellent, very comfortable to use with one hand. 3. Stereo Speakers - most awesome speakers. Even flagships like S5 do not offer quality speakers like Moto, they don't even have stereo. 4. Camera - excellent performance in sunlight, photos look crisp and sharp. Average performance in low light with flash. COULD'VE BEEN BETTER 1. Option to turn of syncs completely - right now have to manually untick every option. (this is more of a stock android problem, I being an avid CyanogenMod user) CONS 1. Charger with detachable USB cable - the out of box charger did not have detachable USB cable so I had to buy it. 2. Device heats up when performing things simultaneously like playing games and app updates from play store. (does not heat up when playing games only) If you can tolerate these very minor cons, I think you should go for this device. Its the best in this range.",

Facebook, whatsapp and instagram only three applications on 2G network, no wifi, no camera, no video streaming, broswer a couple of times to follow up with the facebook links (texts only) and it's 4% already by 12.30 AM. Service centre executive says only replacing phone would work and nothing else. I had suggest all you people buying to do a complete battery test, atleast run on continous internet so you had replace with one within the period. Also, wish for flikpart to get you an unused product.",

The feel of the phone is great and the matt finish of the back cover gives you an amazing feeling. It has a very soft and delicate touch. Comparable to apple (I have an iPad). It has a decent primary camera. The phone does not experience any lag and games like Asphalt run seamlessly. Moto has provided useful apps like Assist. However the battery backup is not that great. It drains out in under 16 hours even after very little use.",

Now coming to the phone, after ordering the cell i read about the device and many of them said the cell heats up a lot, lags, takes long time to charge. i didn't face any kind of lag till now after installing many apps, yes the charger bundled with the product is not up to the mark but then i changed my charger and use the one provided with my nexus 7, and with that charger the cell get full charged in almost one and half hours without heating! many of them said the battery is bad but that's not the case, if you are a normal user you'll get almost 16 hours of backup which is the best at this price point. for a gamer you can get 8-10 hours of usage. the camera of the device is awesome, the focus control and other feature, simply love it. the user interface is minimal and easy to use which i love. the customization by other companies make the device lag. i didn't face any issues with sim card, calling function or wifi connection as described by others. the stereo speakers are the best, people have said that the sound cracks, you can easily change the audio effects from the settings and i would advice you not to keep the media volume at full as you may feel the difference, keep it one or two times below and you'll get the perfect stereo experience. the build quality of the phone is sturdy and fits perfectly in hand, didn't face any issues with the display or screen quality, it works as expected. if your budget is around 15-20k go for this product without hesitation. none the devices from other companies can give you such build quality and beautiful looking phone a big thumbs up for Motorola and Flipkart for giving the perfect device (Delhivery you suck!!!) Moto @(2nd Generation) rocks!!!!!!!!!!",

Again problems with the screen (faded colour on the top left side of the screen). The biggest problem is you cannot get in touch with technical department directly.

Or u cant not play music while playing a game or in game like clash of clans keypad goes down inbetween typing. N also it takes lot of more time to load a online game than samsung. It having worst internet access i ever faced. If u are 2g user u need to forget browsing, any cheaper samsung or micromx mobile beat itmoto g2 4-5 times. Picture quality is not good as u want , moto e having gud coloured displaye than g2 ... About gameplay do not demand any shooting game... much lags. Camera is gud than asus zfone5 or p81. (Chk camera wisly my handset fails to capture white at centered photos) ( n if it not responds u need to restart , even for face unlocking also). also face unlocking is not gud ( any mmx canvas is much better in this) any other person can open it n many times urself u cant open it ...epic fail. About speed of using ...( is like running in river u cant get as speed as u can do ) i m not impressed by speed animated opening takes lot of time after some use ( nearly 15 Days)... Sound no doubt awesome. Another bad thing is u cant see upload n dload working or not ( an internet E logo with two opposite arrows along signal) System is just copy pasted from moto e ...icons r blurish. So if u are a gamer kind user or gud internet user dont think to buy it.",

With 3G, I get 12-15 hours without any fuss. With WiFi, its even more. There is also a default batter saver option in Settings. Switch that on. Also, adjust the screen brightness when you're outdoors and indoors. Sometimes the Auto brightness indoors is quite bright and you don't require so much brightness indoors. I use the phone a lot including media player in a day. If I remove my phone from charging at 9 in the morning, I charge it again next morning around 7/8am. This phone is very good. Not much different from the First Gen. The only thing better is the camera and the screen size. Otherwise, its just like the first gen. And we all know how good the first gen is. I dont want to comment on the specs as they're similar to the First Gen. The camera though is quite good, in low light too. Front camera is also great in low light. The phone comes with stock Android. So that's another plus. I read some reviews which described the battery life as poor, hence i was skeptical before i could purchase this. But once I bought it, I have no regrets. Yes, there will be some handsets with some issues, but you cannot get 100% efficiency in anything. I would totally recommend this phone for anyone looking for high end low budget smartphone. At 13k, its a steal.",

Firstly, there is an issue with the quality of speaker - when I receive call, Voice is not clear to hear ( A basic need/ Requirement of a phone) And if I have to receive call in busy traffic then god should help to understand what a caller is saying (As voice is not clear). Secondly, I noticed when I receive call most time my voice reflects back to me (Damn irritating). Thirdly, an ear phone given by company is another big waste ....Sound quality is very\u2026 very .. very\u2026 bad...... Overall I can say \"There is no use if a phone cannot function its basic functionality\" - Not worth for money I paid. Now to Flipkart ---> Dear Flipkart, At least make sure before promoting/ Branding any product works well for it's know basic functionality, else no customer will trust you or buy any product from you.",

On calling flipkart , they informed that the phone cannot be replaced as it is more than a month. While it was just 10 days above the month(11th Sep 2014 to 22nd Oct 2014). On calling the Service center (Bell and tell Teleservices) we were informed to get the phone to service center. After 1 day, service center informed that the display was damaged due to physiscal damage. Flipkart informed that the warranty cannot be claimed as it was due to physical damage. Neither the service center nor Flipkart is able to prove the physical damage. Me being the owner of the phone, it is only me who knows if the phone had a physical damage or not. I am very dissatisfied with the service of Flipkart and Motorola and i Think this is just a way of avoiding the claim and reimbursement of the phone. I suggest please avoid buying atleast ecltronic items from flipkart.",

I start using my phone in the morning with 100% charging. By noon it drains to 40%. by 2 pm it requires fresh charging. Every hour it will charge only for additional 10 odd percentages. 2. the phone book has some serious problem. Opening contacts displays white screen for a long time. Contact names appear, and then if I search something the contacts disappear. Application closes abruptly. 3. Similar problem happens with Call logs. Sometimes, it doesn't even recognise the names and only the number displays without any name when someone is calling. 4. Poor Truecaller also stops abruptly. So much with even the replacement set. :(",

I have read negatives reviews about electronic goods and mobile sales on flipkart but always ignored them. I ordered Moto G 2 for Diwali.It was delivered fine. In 3 days the screen blinked on and off,touch got less effective, and then one fine day when I woke up half display was missing and touch stopped working. Immediately I made a contact with Customer team. They informed by 29th Oct they should rectify the issue but no calls from them, just mobile updates. And then Another message came that the date will be 31oct now. I totally regret buying it from flipkart. I have asked for a replacement and since I see many reviews on that part too I shall update my review once I get replacement done..If any?? 31 Oct: I received replacement phone. Have not yet used it and I hope it works fine. Having read reviews here lot of people got phone replaced and they were too having defects so keeping fingers crossed!!",

So it is technically more renowned brand than Nokia or Samsung in Mobile phone market. My Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others. Looks: edges are not sharp, finishing is somewhat blunt and dull compared to ASUS Zenfones. Body: Easy to hold and handle though it's size is quite bigger than it may look. Back cover is so durable and more easy to open than a bottle cap!!!! it is sealed from inside out making it water and dust resistant to an extent. If you take the white version of this phone you will need a phone cover to protect it from stains! but you can open the phone back cover anytime and wash it and put it back :D Screen: Corning gorilla glass 3 is something you may not believe before seeing. its smoother than ice but harder than past gorilla glasses. Still i use a Matte finish screen guard just for the looks it provide. phone booting time: 28 secs generally. phone power off time:13 secs generally. Phone accessibility: U.I is very smooth as it runs on Stock Android 4.4.4 as on Nexus phones only. no default file manager app. No notepad app. so many basic apps miss out in stock android. You will have to download them. 3G is very fast esp in Vodafone and airtel in cities. Navigation is smooth. music player is fluid except it interrupts for 0.5 secs when you tilt the phone from vertical to horizontal positions or vice versa. call facility is fluid. so is messaging. Notifications panel is nice to work with. but notification light is dull compared to blackberry's. sometimes you may face problems with receiving calls as the 'slide-n-answer' feature does not work at times but its very rare. I am trying to find out why it happens. Sound: Very LOUD! Camera: 8Mp is like Lumia's 5Mp. so nothing much to jump for! but front camera of 2Mp is good. Battery: 2070 mAh. With D.U Battery app it gives you more or less 1 day/24 Hours backup. please charge your phone for 8 hours after buying as they say if you want proper backup.

I ordered the device 4-5 days before diwali, the expected delivery time was 10 days due to festive season, but it was delivered to me in 3 days, surprisingly. i also ordered a moto g back case along with it which arrived the a day after that. Moto G is a very well designed and thought out phone. I have handed it over to many of my not-so-Tech-aware friends, and they thought it was one more of those 30K phones with large screens. There's the look factor. As far as performance is concerned: I switched from an iPhone 4S to Moto G, so just comparing the two phones - I find Moto G much faster and crisper in terms of the interface. From an Android vs iOS perspective, there's just so much more you can do with Android than iOS. Apps like Whatsapp, PushBullet and Good work so much well on Android due to the deeper integration possible in the Android. Not to mention the whole issue with downloading songs using iTunes into iOS, which is such a buzzkill. I am a big supporter of low-end phones like Moto G now (coming from a person who has been using Apple since >3 years). The high end phones are not worth it. They will give you the following things for 15K more of money. 1. NFC - Hardly accessible in India 2. 4G LTE - Not widely available in India - prices still high 3. Higher resolution - I mostly use my phones for reading news articles and watching HD videos- There is no need for full HD resolution in both - The internet bandwidth in India is hardly conducive to Full HD videos 4. Better battery life - I think this is the only thing in the list I would actually pay for. But in the end the trade-off comes to be like 500-800 more of mAh vs Rs. 15K. I think you could get a portable power bank for Rs. 3-4K (the best one in the market). So still Moto G wins. Best of luck. There's more to life than spending on extravagant phones. Play smart.

I had much more expectation with MOTO G2. 1- When i started to use phone it shut down automatically. 2- Hearing voice use to stop after every 4-5 calls automatically, I have to restart the same after that it works but only for 4-5 calls. I was not able to receive the call. 3- Very poor battery - Charging time is more than discharging time. 4- After 7 days, hanging problem has been started. 5- Browsing problem \u2013 buffering \u201cduring 3G activation\u201d 6- Phone heating problem 7- even 25th day, a phone has been dead. I am really highly disappointed with MOTO G2 & don\u2019t want carry any more. Friends, Please avoid the phone otherwise, I promise, you will remember my words. I don\u2019t have any problem with flipkart, I am very old costumer of flipkart & first time I am facing such type of problem. I have complained in flipkart costumer care, they picked up the same for exchange. But exchange is not a ultimate solution, because there is some technical manufacturing fault, I am sure that it\u2019ll not resolved.",

            "comment": "I have used two moto g2 phones for one month. These are my observations. Cons: 1. Phone and the charger gets heated up badly during charging. Phone screen turns hot while watching a video for few seconds. Phone usually heats up during potential activities like using camera, on call, watching videos etc. 2. Touch sensitivity is not up to the mark. 3. The SAR value could be higher. As a result I suffer mild headache following a phone conversation which did not happen in my Nokia and Samsung phones. So using ear phones could solve the problem. 4. Battery consistency is extremely bad. I use my phone few mins to talk in a day, Check few mails and WhatsApp for few mins. Overall a very minimal usage and yet the battery lasts for only around 6-8 hours with full charge. 5. The case covers and screen guards are not widely available outside. It's very expensive online. I can as well get another phone for price of a case cover. I have been visiting shops in my locality since a month. 6. Camera quality is just OK. 7. PPI is less compared to the moto g1. So image quality appears less crisp. 8. Looks like cheap plastic used for back case cover. Not sturdy as 1st gen. So the back case can easily break. Pros: 1. Good deal for this price. I got it just lesser than 10k for an offer. 2. Bigger screen is an advantage and disadvantage at times. 3. Not much lags and hangs till date. 4. Front Stereo speakers are just great. Ultimately a good deal for this price.",

Only the screen guard which came with it was not good and i replaced it. 2.Camera is very good.No complaints. 3.UI is excellent.No lags.Even when running multiple background apps. 4.Only the battery is not upto the mark. But make no mistake.1 hour of calls,20-30 pictures, 1-2 hours of net usage(2G), and another 1 hour of onscreen usage will sail you through the day with 30% of charge still left when you go to bed. 5. Those who have very sluggish internet speeds after switching to this phone...turn off location and restrict background data of Google Play Store and Google Services. You won't belive the amount of background data and battery these two consumes. Close you eyes and go for Moto G. PS- Flipkart's delivery and packaging was excellent.",

            "comment": "I purchased this phone for my younger brother. This is his first Android phone ever. What I like about Moto G is that Motorola is giving a very balanced phone at a very nice base price. It has all the essentials one would absolutely want from an Android phone but it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The biggest problem with Android is that it gets slow over time. I don't know if that will happen with Moto G also or not as this is yet to be seen. This is an inherent Android problem and not of this hardware because Windows Phone based on same hardware such as Lumia 730 works really fast. With the Android problem aside, this phone is good enough for anyone. It comes with a really good and sharp screen at near Retina Display quality with 1 GB RAM which is enough in Android for light use with 2, 3 apps running in background. At fresh boot with nothing installed this phone had only 370 MB RAM left which is something I find bad. The OS and Motorola bundled services are eating too much RAM and very less is left for user's own apps. The camera is a standard 8 MP camera. It takes good pictures in well lit conditions. I haven't been able to test low light picture quality. Audio quality from earphones or Bluetooth handsfree is also fine. It is big due to a lot of bezel around the screen. Motorola needs to reduce this in Moto G 3rd generation. Also, 5\" screen is too much. A 4.5\" screen size with higher PPI or AMOLED screen which further reduces battery consumption which is what I would recommend. No need to give gigantic screen sizes, if you want that, launch another phone between Moto G and Moto X. Keep Moto G at 4.5\" screen size as not everyone wants a gigantic phone. I purchased a Sandisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSD card for this phone as it is good enough to keep music, pictures and videos. I only keep apps in the phone memory. The battery could have been better. Android is anyway not good with battery life. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good enough and fast Android phone at a justified price.",

I can now say this phone is pretty awesome. I am not having any problems with the battery backup. It lasts almost a full day with moderate usage. If I have WiFi on, it lasts a little less, but still gets me through the day. There is no File Manager, you need to get another third party app for that like ES File Explorer. Android is as stock as it could get. No bloatware at all. Now it's time for the Games. Not just normal ones but heavy games. I play Asphalt 8, FIFA 14 and FIFA 12; and it all runs butter smooth. The RAM is only 1GB, but it still manages to run the game smoothly. The only problem with the 1GB RAM is that multitasking is a little harder. The phone is hell bent on killing apps, so if you have more than 4 apps on, 1 would be killed by the time you open it. Nothing big, though. Headphones are great. One problem is that we can't change the Notification LED Light. Overall, a pretty good phone. I would recommend it to anyone.",

The Camera has some issues and goes off /needs restart of phone every now and then. also the auto flash does not work at times. the sim slot also seem to have prob. It all of a sudden disables my sim. this is really irritating. the touch also does not work properly at times specially while typing and playing games.

What I observed is that this product is ultimate with all features which a 20K and above mobiles are providing at a price of 13K. Pros: 1. Huge internal memory of more than 13 GB in 16 GB. 2. Excellent photos 3. Best User Interface (even a child can handle the features). 4. Can handle even the hardcore games like Real Racing 3 without any issues. 5. External memory with a capacity of upto 32 GB. 6. Dual speakers with good output. I installed mx player, a free app from playstore through which the sound is mind blowing. 7. Direct access to google drive, google photos. So we can have cloud store of more than 15 GB of data. Cons : 1. No NFC 2. Battery capacity of 2070 mah could have been a little higher. If we use wifi or play games, battery life is around 6 to 8 hours. Otherwise approx 16 hrs.3. No USB cable provided. Not even screen guard is provided with the product. 4. No file manager. I had to install a free app called ES file explorer which is a very EXCELLENT one. Finally, the service of flipkart is appreciated. Within 2 days, I got the product. Immediately on unboxing and inserting SIM, all recent software updates got installed. Really nice. Best buy for the price tag. You will definetely like the product. Go for it.",

I have ordered the product on 12th Oct 2014, it was delivered on 13th Oct because I have opted for \"Flipkart First\" subscription for Rs 500/- a year. When I opened the package, first thing that strikes is mobile has a scratch guard on it which doesn't have the logo of Motorola which you normally get when you purchase a product in a sealed pack condition. I have purchased Moto e and couple of my friends have purchased Moto G from Flipkart but all had that logo on the scratch guard. Which means I had been provided a refurbished product which someone might have returned. It was not at all expected from Flipkart, when we are rooting for them against some foreign biggies, they shouldn't fool their customers like this. If you really want to sell refurbished product then you better list it out on your website. When I contacted their Customer Care in the middle of night after identifying the fraud, instead of immediately taking the replacement request all they did was take the request for a call back from their technical team. While today on 14th Oct when I again contacted them, another executive placed the replacement request immediately. Since I have already subscribed for the in a day delivery, the least I'm expecting is they provide a brand new product in a day which is 14th Oct or latest by 15th Oct afternoon. However, here onwards I would think twice before ordering anything from Flipkart. There is no need to hold a \"Big Billion Day\", just give us good offers and good service and stop cheating. Hoping to get a brand new product \"In a Day\". - A Pissed Off Customer",

Most of the Review I read told me that the Phone display is not so Great or that the battery wont last long, and that the phone over heats ! Phone's display is amazing. You wont even notice the drop in pixel density ! The 5 inch screen is really good. I cannot boast about the phones I've owned over the days, but from the Experience that I have using phones that belong to my friends , I can tell you that If you are looking for a phone below 15,000. Go for the 2nd Gen Moto G ! I know there is HTC and other phones which are way better, but there is something about the Moto G that makes it a dependable phone. The feeling that you have holding it in your hands, Knowing that a fall or a hit wont break it so easily. Let me break it down in native review language Pros ********************** 1) The feeling of Holding it in your hand. 2) The screen is far better than advertised by the reviewers. 3) Have you tried MACRO Photography using the camera ? BRILLIANT ! 4)The speakers are Good -- > Not great -- > but better than those who complain( Sometimes it good for people to understand that the sound that comes out of those speakers also depend on the file type , the bit rate of what you play). Also about the speakers , True stereo (Nothing compared to HTC) but worth the money ! 5) The feel Good factor :) Cons ---- NO , I wont call it that, Things to Improve ************************************************************* 1) Battery People who just got the phone like me tend to use if for hours on end, without giving the phone a break ----> The battery wont last long -- > 6 to 7 hours MAX ! People who have used it for a month now , finally giving the new phone a rest --- > Battery might last a whole day , If you are at work and rarely get time to play around with the phone, Then I'm sure It will last an Entire day . Battery Could have been better . On a final note, I love the phone. Its everything that I have paid for and more. Thank you Motorola for this amazing Handset !",

            "comment": "I just got my Moto G 2nd gen phone yesterday from flipkart, and I am loving it. Let me tell you that I just upgraded from a Sony W8 which I have been using for last 3 years. So my jump was pretty huge. From Android 2.1 to Kitkat. 128mb ram to 1GB, and a lot of other features. I also intend to keep this phone as long as the previous one. I loved the kitkat version and since Moto G would be one of the first phones to get the Android L upgrade coming this month, I am more excited. Display : Screen is amazing. Pretty clear, and resolution is perfect. Brightness is not a matter of concern. Performance : Based on one day i would say much, but the screen toggle and app opening has been pretty smooth. Games like Asphalt 8 ran quite decently. Wifi and my 2G worked well, giving good speed for net usage. I was happy with it. touch is also smooth. Felt no lags yet. Camera: well I lost interest in phone cameras some time ago. It is not that great, but not bad too. The settings look very mediocre, and they could have had more features I guess. Front camera was quite decent. I took a few good selfies with it. Music: The sound is a bit disappointing even with the dual stereo speakers. The headphones are also very normal, and the earpiece don't fit well in my ears. Storage : 16 gb internal memory of which 12.79 gb is for user. I have used up 3 gb for apps already, but another 9gb free is quite good. Also have a 32 gb expandable external slot. Battery: I charged till 100 and used wifi continuously for 14 hours till it drained out completely. Then I started charging again and its taking quite some time. Well its a new battery too. But I have o wait before i comment more about battery here. The charger is a single piece which i didnt like, unlike the usb to micro usb connector types. Doesnt come with other accesories like tv connector etc like old mobiles did, but I never used them anyways. Neither did they feel obliged to add in one extra shell. We have to pay almost 1k extra for that. But all in all I am impressed with the phone, as I am guessing its performance is in par with some of the higher end phones, with double or triple its price. Received the phone from Flipkart without much hassle in 2 days. Update after 3 days : ---------------------------- The performance of the phone is just awesome. I have been playing games like Asphalt 8 for the whole day and it seldom hangs for a moment or show lags. But it does heat up, but I think that is to be expected. But the battery is a great disappointment. Candy Crush 'crushes' it in 3-4 hours itself. With other games like Asphalt and Temple Run, it does give some more, but still you can expect only about 6 hours and around. Otherwise you get a whole day if you are not so active on the phone with wifi. Wifi drains the battery too.That's a bit of a disappointment in the battery side. Battery-saver switches off wifi on its own. For a person like me who buys a new phone once in 4-5 years, I think battery is a prime criteria. So taking off a star. Calls are clear and decent. Internet is fast. Screen is smooth.",

Best thing about this phone is that it works without any lag. You can experience heavy games like Arkham origins, Modern Combat, Dead Trigger, Asphalt 8 ,etc. 2mp front camera is good and the Primary camera is equipped with 8mp with flash so it gives you a boost in this budgeted phone. Also the phone is quipped with Qualcomm quad core processor and you get a internal memory of 16gb ( 5 gb shared so that makes it to 11 gb approx). Sound Quality is also nice. Must buy. Overall flipkart service always rocksss ... keep it up guys",

Touch response and performance is also good. No lag while playing games and HD videos. Sound quality is superb. RAM is showing 850mb, what is the problem Motorola ? why 100mb less ? It should be 950mb. Overall the product is good. If you want to buy a product for its quality in this range and do not want to visit the service center after few months, then buy Moto. You will also get the Nexus type feelings in this range.",

It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine. 3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. 4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!",

Nice to hold in hand. No lag even on highest game settings. I tried Fifa 15, Call of Duty, NFS MW, Real Racing 3 Only con is the battery, while writing this review battery drops from 35% to 27% in 2G with no app in background (I am using Greenify). This is horrible. All going good except the battery but just after opening the back cover twice for incerting sim & sd card, the backcover become loose. Now its making terrible \"kat kat\" noise while holding it in hand. I called flipkart on 1800####, tell them. They say its my mistake that i opened it in wrong way. But lol i am a gadget freak. I owned htc desire 816, nexus 4, galaxy s duos, galaxy tab 2, Canvas hd.... I hav two tech blogs for reviewing gadgets & a quite popular YouTube channel. I checked the unboxing many times, read manual book only then i have opened the back panel very carefully. I never expect this from flipkart. Highly disappointed.",

Thank you !!! I have been on the replaced device for only 3 days now. Considering the price I paid for the phone ( INR12,999 ) a quick rundown of the few , but significant items. 1) Call quality: 4/5 2) 3G vs 2G reception: Unsure if this is the network provider's issue. VoIP apps drops the connection frequently. Will post an update after extended use. 3) Overall feel & build quality : 4/5 4) Camera : 4/5 . I like the built in HDR feature. You can switch between 16:9 (6 Megapixels) and 4:3 mode (8 Megapixels ) 5) Pre-loaded apps: No bloatware that unlike some Korean manufacturers. 6) Battery: Lasts all day, with 3G tuned on and occasional WiFi use 7) Screen : 4/5 Overall : 4 on 5",

Excellent value for money 2. Great build quality 3. Expandable memory with usable internal memory of 12 gb is just awesome 4. Fast processing - no lags at all even in demanding games 5. Decent camera 6. Decent battery life - i get 3-3.5 hours of on-screen time with 22+ hours on single charge on single sim...almost same as s3 6. Vanilla android, minimal bloatware - higher free ram 7. Screen quality - i dont find any significant difference coming from s3 ( honestly never liked the over saturated colours on s3) 8. Good sound from front dual speakers 9. Touch response is good Falls short in :- 1. 1 gb ram is not good enough for multi-tasking..1.5 gb ram at least would have been better. For e.g. when running chrome, poweramp consistently shuts down 2. Camera could have been better, s3 camera was better 3. Battery non-removable - if your device stops responding u may have a tough time Overall, it is a budget phone which will definitely not disappoint. Take my word I don't miss my galaxy S3 after getting this beast. Go get it.",

I had full charged it for more than 8 hrs continuously and started using over wifi. I haven't inserted any SIM in the first day. After charging I put for idle one night. Next day when I tried to switch on it, it was not turned on. I got wondered. Later charged it for 5-10 minutes and i could able to switch-on it. I found that the battery dried up fully. I had connected the charger till full charging again and repeated the same case of previous day. Even in stand by not getting at least 12hrs battery backup without running any applications. The applications were running only the default apps coming with the phone. Another thing I noticed is charger is getting overheated always. White colour charger is not upto he expected standards. Most amazingly I had tried to connect this via USB cable to my laptop. While connecting to USB , its univeral law that the device getting charged from the desktop/laptop. But this device is not charging here also. Other than I haven't fined any issues with the product, but remember that I didnt install any application or used this much. 3 days I spent to check the charging nature of the device. Placed a request to replace this, but flipkart customer service is also not feels good. hey have tried me twice in the contact number and the conenction was not good from their end.

Moto Assist is nice inbuilt app that can be helpful in automatically changing the setting from ring to silent depending on your calender. Cons: Camera APP is not comfortable to use. I had to download Google Camera, but that hangs sometimes. The inbuilt dialler is not user friendly and you might need to download a dialler app that suits you. Battery may be an issue if you are continuously on games. Though after initial first few overnight charge cycles the battery run longer. Touch Sensitivity on phone for most part is good, but sometimes it seems to think I have tapped the phone rather slide it. I would still give this phone a 4 Rating as some of the cons may be removed when OS is upgraded to Android L.",

Moto G2... this phone is HOT... yup very hoooot. 1st Day Experience: It became hot at rear camera after 5 minutes usage. Not able to hold it even. Camera clarity disappointed. 2nd Day Experience: Downloaded few apps(VLC, whatsApp, Flash light, subway surf, temple run) Took 3 snaps. Again heating problem at rear camera. Not able to hold it. 3rd Day Experience: No File manager exist inbuilt so downloaded File Manager App. Copied 800mb movie & 150mb song(both HD clarity) Both haven't run with inbuilt app. Used VLC to play them. Noticed a lag while running 800mb file movie. No lag with 150mb file. After 10 mins usage of Wifi & playing 10 mins video phone became hot again. Today's(4th Day) Experience: Heating problem is same, it becomes very hot at rear camera after 10 mins usage. Surprisingly Pics quality increased, both rear & front cams giving good clarity pics. Heating Heating Heating... No USB cable provided. Headphones are normal, not in-ear, quality is average. No File Manager & Menu button provided inbuilt.(Can't do multiple deletions or selection) Two speakers, but Stereo speakers, sound is OK. No secondary mic, no noice control, pic & video clarity is just OK. Inbuilt battery(for me I am normal user so Satisfied) Except the above 5\" inch screen is very cool.. good clarity, good touch, good design, good memory, kitkat, 8MP 2MP Camera, good browsing experience, gaming experience is very satisfied, I dont recommend this coz what is the use of having so many features... this heating problem is irritating & burning my hand after every 10 - 15 mins of usage. Not even able to hold it or keep in pocket.",

PS :- Flipkart delivered with in 9 hours ! wow thats great, not a word for flipkart. Hope i helped you. Regards",

I received it yesterday, I found this phone to be very good. All the praises everywhere around about the resurgence of Motorola and the positive reviews were the reasons for me to opt for the 2nd gen Moto G (and my budget too :P). And I must say, even after such huge expectations, I'm not disappointed. No need for me to delve into the specifications, as Flipkart has summarised them very well. Till now, I haven't found any problems worth writing about. But there's just one problem with Android Kitkat (it's not a con of this phone, mind it). You cannot set the default memory for your bluetooth transfers to your external SD card. All the files are occupying the internal storage, and I can't even move the files later to the external SD card (I'm using Androzip file manager). This is the only con that I found till now. Everything else is great. Highly recommended for those who want to buy a smartphone under 15k. :)",

Display is brilliant and plays videos with great clarity 1 gb ram + Snapdragon processor does not make any kinds of lags atleast on the basic usage. I haven't tried gaming yet but im sure this phone can handle high end games. OK google works perfectly Camera is awesome..both front and back camera are good Good internal storage...SD card expandability is also there..SO plenty of memory available. Latest version of android 4.4.4 CONS: Charger is only 550mah so it takes a lot of time to charge..better try other chargers. Heats up a bit sometimes...only sometimes(Usually all android phones heat up) Earphones are just OK but not good for listening music..buy a good earphones if u want to enjoy music. Battery backup could have been upto 2500mah but still it works for a day with moderate use. People don't go crazy over Xiaomi.. Buying that phone itself is so difficult then imagine their after sales service. Also MOTO has a good brand image and after sales is growing widely in India. This is the best phone to buy if ur budget is around 10-15k Motorola has literally killed the market...Keep rocking moto...And THanks to flipkart",

Low brightness of screen.....not suitable for outside usage......... 5. Not updating to latest system update.....i.e. Aug. 26 based kernel.... 6.

However, the screen resolution at 720p looks pretty dull when I set the brightness to Auto mode. 1080p is required for 5 inch smartphones. The standard camera does not allow auto flash or flash function and the option keys are hidden on the right side. I downloaded the Google Camera app and now it is working fine. The phone is nice to hold but after slipping on the protective cover it looks bigger and bulky. I have also applied a matt finish screen guard which changed to looks of the phone. Overall the user experince is nice. 1 GB Ram + 16GB internal + 32 GB microSD makes the phone a small datacenter. The best experience of all this is Motorola Migrate app which allowed me to copy the data of my old phone in a flash.",

            "comment": "I've been using this phone for the last two weeks and here is my review..... 1. Look: There is no remarkable change from the previous moto g in overall but the addition of duall speaker in front makes the phone looks like moto e but look more premium. 2. Performance: If u used the moto g 1st gen then there is no difference in performance since both have same processor and ram but the slight upgrade in the display size (0.5 inch) makes the 2nd one better in our experience. 3. Camera: Here is the big difference from the first gen.moto. the rear cam is equipped with 8mp autofocus camera but no image stabilizer. But moto g 2 takes descent foto in outdoor and good image in low light also. The front cam is 2mp cam and it is quite good for video calling but not that good for selfie. 4. Battery: Here is the down point of the 2nd gen from the 1st one. If u used the phone with 3g on and display always on with surfing or listening song the battery will last only for 7 hrs from full charged to hit 5%. But it is not that bad because we hardly use phone like that. But I tested myself to know the performance. For normal users with some surfing, listening some songs, talking with girlfriend and playing some casual game the battery will last for almost a day. Due to having bigger screen I expected this from the battery as u know guys. 5. Gaming Performance: The moto g 2 can also handle all the present HD games just like the previous one. I tested MC4, NFSMW, Asphalt 8, Fifa 14, Dead trigger 2 and Nova 3. All games run quite smooth without seeing noticeable frame drop. Due to having sharp and crisp 720p display and deliver descent viewing angle u will find comfortable playing HD games in this Phone. Final verdict: If u r hardcore gamer and camera lover but don't want to burn a hole in ur pocket then This device is specially for u. It is much better than the other mid range phone from Sony Samsung HTC since those phone's price will fall nearly on 20k with the same specs. I experience Xiaomi mi3 myself which deliver premium specs and performance but can't promise the after sale service like OS upgrade repairing etc. Besides Xaiomi phones have some issues which are so frequent in many of their phone but not all like heating problem losing signal etc.",

Had placed order on 9th Sep in First Day Launch Offer and received the order on 10th (as promised In a Day delivery, Rs. 90 Extra). I am ok with Rs. 90 extra cost for such an assured delivery in a day. So as usual Flipkart at its best. I am a happy & satisfied consumer of Flipkart till date. Honest Review of the Device: A smartphone which has capacity to handle multitasking with nice Camera, Sound & UI. Though there are some cons too. PROS - 1. Good UI, touch is awesome, better than Samsung Galaxy Grand or Micromax Canvas. I liked the launcher and the bright inbuilt wallpapers which is not like cheap androids. It has a class. Four Star. 2. Sound system is awesome. I liked the sound system if you have a headphone with ear-bud. The Bass/treble/Vocal/Bass Punch modes are fabulous. Five Star. 3. Camera is too good with the price range. I have used Lumia 720/Galaxy Grand, compared to these it has advanced features. Secondary camera can capture nice Selfie. Four Star. 4. First time user of Kitkat version of Android. Its a very light OS compared to JB. No hang/lag observed during regular operation/accessing internet. Though I am not crazy for Games, though basic games (Temple Run2, Crazy Grandpa, Rail Rush, Asphalt Bike runs smooth). Four Star. 5. Keyboard is just awesome. Kitkat OS has some good featured Keyboard. You can just drag the word you want to type, it will fetch it automatically. This feature is best while travelling/walking. Five Star.Four Star. 6. Connectivity is good and dont have any problem with it. Both SIM works perfect together. Four Star. 7. Speaker output is perfect with two front speakers. Four Star. CONS - 1. Battery is average, no so good backup like Nokia. If you use Wifi/3G for more than two hours a day, it drains fast. Though in 2G it gives you good life. I need to make frequent calls/sms for 8 hours in a day which is not an issue with the device. Three Star. 2. Heats up a little bit while charging, but do not pay attention to it. Its a minimum heat which generates like many other Androids like Samsung/HTC/Micromax/Xolo/Xiomi MI3 etc. while charging. Three Star. 3. The Headset which is given inside the Box is very normal and with low quality. Two Star. 4. No Data cable is given inside the box, its only a Socket charger. Two Star. Hope the review will be helpful all the buyers who are planning to get it. I would say, GO FOR IT, its the BEST ANDROID (Kitkat) PHONE IN RANGE OF 13K.",

May be it is not much in No's but faith is one part where i am falsely commited by your partner.) I have placed my order on 6th Sep'14 (ODA6829931639PCVNH00) with launch day 6 offers - which was said to be delivered on 11th (5 days after ordering). I followed up again on 12th for delayed and was replied to deliver again on 18th (12 days). which was also false committed. There was no mail for delay. Finally i cancelled my order, where in they are not at all concerned or to apologize. This may be that they have saved there offer but lost customer (May be customer's). I am thankful to god that i have not paid for it (it was COD). But if it would have been paid, I would have gone mad for making follow-up with flipkart.",

Looks wise it is beautiful with curvy edges, Performance wise awesome , all the apps and games are running smoothly without glitches , no usb cable friends , they have given a universal usb port so you can connect any usb cable. Battery backup is decent. I charge the battery in morning for 1 and half hour and till coming to home from office at 9 pm the battery still has around 15% remaining , during the day i use 3g extensively and also play lots of games. Conclusion: In the budget of 10k-14k, this phone really stands no.1",

But the offers that were for the launch day buyers were actually ridiculous. Not of much work for majority. Anyway...that's not important. Lets come to the phone performance- 1. Camera- 8/10 +Very good picture & video quality, good slow motion video recording, flash also good. Low light photos are equally good for the flash. photos and videos can be made in full dark also. use the flash as a torch also using downloaded torch app or cleanmaster app's widget. Front camera is also very good. -But after zooming not that much picture clarity. 2. Display- 9/10 +5 inch screen very attractive and display quality also good. Gorilla glass protection helps very much. screen protector is not must for that. -The screen guard provided was not set good. very bad. 3. Game- 8/10 +Every game I tried works quite good. games like gta vice city, fifa 14, max payne, asphalt 8 etc. -But Graphics can be set maximum to 60-65% range for flawless performance. Otherwise the game cant be played for lag (checked only for gta vice city). But its not that much problem as upto 60-65% range the graphics quality is good enough. and the fifa14 stopped several times after tapping 'tap to continue'. I had to reinstall it once and the next time it got fixed automatically. 4. RAM- 10/10 +No LAGS normally. 5. Looks- 10/10 +Very good looking phone. REALLY! both from front and backside. 6. Sound- 7/10 +Good sound quality. call sound is also very loud. -But in some cases (for specific songs or games) its not that much loud. but OK. earphone doesn't go with the phone itself, but OK. 7. Network- 9/10 +No network problem till now. Used Vodafone and Airtel. Both Airtel and Vodafone 3G worked well. 8. Battery- 5/10 -For normal usage like a bit gaming, some camera use, calls, sms, some gps it will give 8-10 hours back up with auto brightness on while not using the phone, I think. But if you use continuously, I think it will not give you more than 2-3 hours backup. I checked for full brightness and much camera use and gaming that it reduce the battery very quickly. Not tried the internet connectivity that much till now. Have ordered a power bank worth Rs. 749! N.B.: The charger I received worked for one day only and then stopped working. does not charge. totally useless. But for me its just nothing problematic because I have same chargers from before as its a very common charger. For most people it wont be a problem. But those who doesn't have those from before, they'll definitely face problems and will have o buy a charger. But I think its a special case that the charger didn't work. It'll work for most of the others, I think. In all, its a good impressive product and keeping aside the battery issue its a good buy in this range. Recommended- 7/10 Happy Shopping :-)",

So Cons are:- 1:- BACK COVER People say it have a rubberised finish but i didnt found it like this .. it's really smooth plastic and slip a bit .(but official flip covers have good variety and have good grip with bakc covers 2. DESIGN I found the design to be bit confusing because while using phone something i end up holding it upside down. i beilve there should be some logo on the front up side too. 3. BATTERY 2070mah . That might average while seeing in number but let me tell you battery backup is quite amazing . you wont have any issues regarding the battery backup . beileve me . only bad thing about battery is that it takes way too much time to charge ..(idk the exact time but its little higher than samsung mobiles of this battery capacity) 4. CHARGER Yes. It do get hot after using . maybe charger is manufactured to work for foreign country plugs and thats why it gets heated here in India ( coz they have added an extra plug on top of the charger) 5. NO USB CABLE. That's quite annoying coz you have to remove back cover always and use a card reader >:O. 6. CAMERA. Quality of camera is superb .. It shoots amazing pics but the interface you see on the camera is 6 MP . if you change it to 8 MP, then dont get full interface of the screen while taking pics .(but that really doesnt matter and doesnt effect resolution and clearity). 7. SPEAKERZZZZZZ Well This is one of the biggest issue with this phone .. phone is not at all loud enough so that you can hear .. will watching an youtube video in your room with your ceiling fan on , you won't hear even a single word . 8. HEADPHONES. Headphones provided with set are really annoying to ears as they are also not so loud + they really hurt after about 30 min of use . (BUT if you use any other headphones liike philips , jbl or samsung ; they work really nice and very loud). One More Thing .. I own an White coloured phone which looks way much better than black one . but white colour is more prone to stuffs like dust , ball pen ink etc but dont worry they get easily removed on hard rubbing .. I would recommend to buy black phone if you are not much interested in showing off but let me tell you . The kind of look you get while holding a white phone is amazing . I Beileve black phone only suits with comapnies like Iphone coz they got glassy back panel. And At Last , i found the flip covers and back covers to be very expensive . 1700 and 800 respectively (Review Dated 18-Sep-14)",

My piece has a bad touch response. Cant even use the phone. Camera: Camera has issues. If you keep flash on/auto and click pictures of very closeby objects like 5 cm or 10 cm close, the flash doesnt turn off. You have to restart the phone and start camera app to turn off the flash. I dont believe camera issue is hardware one, an update might fix it (no updates yet). But still, its annoying. Didnt face any heating while using yet. Charger gets hot, but not that you cant hold it in your hand. But it takes time to charge. SD card: SD card gets disconnected when phone is on, or even sometimes doesn't detect SD card. I had enquired on phone about the phone having issues while the phone was still being shipped. I saw 4-5 continuous reviews, where people faced problems. I asked the sales representative about the phone, as many people had received defective pieces, whether the batch they received was good or not. They told me, that the product is good, no problems are there. Requesting for replacement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19/9/14 12.51 pm Flipkart representatives called me regarding the return request. They told me to do a factory reset. I did that, put all the details, email id etc. Still touch is having problems and SD card is getting unmounted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19/9/2014 4.05 pm My phone is dead now within 24 hrs without using. Not starting at all. I might have used it for only 2 hours, from the usage stats in phone. I didn't have a micro sim so couldn't use call functions. Touch was defective and SD card was getting unmounted. And now its dead. Highly disappointed with Motorola. They should atleast give better phones than Micromax, or Chinese Phones. Don't dump phones which were rejected by EU/US standards in India. Flipkart should stop selling Moto G 2nd gen for sometime, until Motorola realizes its mistake. Please new buyers, don't buy this phone until Motorola improves the product. Many products are defective. Wait if you want to buy Moto G 2nd gen. Go for Android one if urgent. Then you can change over after sometime.",

Now coming to the Phone itself Motorola has done quite a few major changes that has brought this product in par with all the other competitive phones like Asus Zenfone and Xiaomi Mi3. Pros: 1. Brilliant Display seems Corning Gorilla Glass has done wonders to the screen instead of the display density being a bit less than previous Moto G. 2. Gaming performance is also good. Games like Asphalt 8 and FIFA 14 run flawlessly. 3. Battery backup is average. 4. The stereo speaker is really impressive as the speaker are at the front so while holding the phone the sound doesn't get blocked. Cons: 1. While playing games, the phone does tend to get heated up a bit. 2. Sometimes there is a burning smell of some sort from the earphone jack while using the phone a bit. I hope flipkart sorts out this issue a replace this model. 3. I hoped Motorola to give 2 gb ram in this set. But 1gb is sort of ok is used to a limit. So according to me this phone is quite good for those who wants just the right level of performance and speed.",

I think Motorola ia an American but I disappointed to see chinees manufacturing.after 10 day experience I am giving review as under. Pros: Screen is smooth and crispy. Light weight and comfortable in pocket 5 inch display how ever compact in size, easy to hold in hand. Grip is best. Look wise beautiful then other brand Moto assist is good appl. Cons: Camera both is good not best , Picture quality in zoom is worst. There is no USB data cable. RAM is 1 GB like Moto E why we should spent doublemoney just for front cam & slight more big display ? Internal Memory of moto E also expendable. No file manager provided so I can not found to send voice clip or song by Bluetooth. Connectivity is major problem.can not catch weak tower , while my other Samsung and Intex handset don't loose tower of same service provider (BSNL) so using net is being headache sometime. As phone is made in China there is no difference in configuration with Xiaomy or Gionie etc. No regional language except Hindi is supported so can not read this language in fb, website etc. This type of problem is not in Samsung. Headphone is worst and China brand.charger is OK. In short if you want to by Moto then Moto E is worth for money then Moto G just double price.",

The screen response and viewing angles are awesome 3. Run totally Lag Free 4. Pure Android experience with guaranteed future updates Cons, 1. it heats when you run games and some big applications 2. Battery backup is below average, If you use 2G continue then it gives backup for 7-8 hrs on 3G 5-6 hrs only on WIFI its slight better but not as expected from Motorola 3. Notification light is not bright enough Last Word, Go for it, if you want pure android experience in affordable price and you are ready to compromise battery life and normal heat ups",

I have reduced 1 star since I am unable to listen to music on my car stereo through the Aux input - I used to do this with my earlier phone with no problem whatsoever. However the phone speakers are loud enough to listen to music in the car with reasonable clarity I can listen to music by plugging in a headset, so the 3.5mm input itself works fine. I am now forced to purchase a Bluetooth car hands free set separately in order to listen to music. Hopefully that will work. Based on what I have read online, this problem seems to be a common feature on earlier Moto G and X phones as well.",

Battery drains like anything! So if your usage is mostly at the places where you dont find charging ports you should have a second thought. Overall a brilliant phone!

In normal use battery discharge only 50% in 12-13 hr. In gaming,internet surfing it discharge upto 80% in 6-7 hrs. Phone can play full HD videos, asphalt8, subway surfer etc with no lag or hang. Its a pure android phone which betters its performance as compare to others having same configuration. It has Gorilla Glass 3 & scratch less back cover which is not present in some high budget phones eg:Samsung grand2 worth 19K. A value for money phone. but one thing im sugesting to flipkart that the flip covers and back cover price is too high please provide some offers to it !! love you flipkart!!!",

Charger is too slow takes approx 2.5 to 3 hr to charge from 15% to 100%. 3. Stereo Sound, ahuh aint that impressive nor are its plastic made handsfree. 4. Quad core 1.2 Ghz processor, its takes 1-2 sec to open whatsapp's certain conversation, and uploading 10 images at a time gives a black out of 2 sec. apart from whatsapp its smooth. 5. 1 GB RAM sounds a bit less for the price tag it has got, ASUS gives more. If you don't have any problem with the above things, Go for it ..",

Camera is good in both lightning Conditions.pics are very clear just let the camera 1st focus properly. Design is good. I am very basic user so battery lasts for 1 1/2 days.I feel the battery will last 4 to 5 hrs with heavy and continuous use. If you are a basic user then follow the steps to improve battery performance: 1-off auto sync 2-off WiFi network and data connection when you don't need them 3-GPS system off(location service). 4-use minimumbrightnesss/auto brightness 5-screen timeout 15sec/30sec Performance of phone is lag free and very fast. Recommend: don't use unnecessary background apps. I bought it only for its brand . I hope it will last long. I could buy Micromax but I felt , that is excellent only in spec not in quality. Generally these Brand's products are less time span compared to other good brand like Nokia,moto,apple. Generally its a pain to run service center. Everything is good except battery; but it will improve just after the Android L update. So buy it ;nothing could be better than this on today's date....... After 2-3 day use of its headphone i got the quality sound which ,i feel Better then my nokia wh 208",

Its run os 4.4.4 Android Kit Kat will get update of Android L . The mobile is pretty Fast though it is only 1 gb Ram ...But it works very fast ...No Lagging while playing games ... Internet also works Super Fast (better than d one i was using LUmia 720) ... The front Speakers are big plus to dis phone ..The sound is Loud and clear ! And About the battery If u r using wifi then One Full Charge will give u around 22-24hrs wid some internet usage and songs and some games ( Its solley depends upon the user and how he uses i dnt use wifi ) So 1 thing i didnt lyk was the charger and ear phones datsy i mgiving 4 star ratings to MOTO G The charger becomes hot lyk hell when we charge the phone for 1 hr i m using NOKIA charger which works alright . The ear phones sucks ! Pretty ordinary road type earphones !.I feel Moto G should have charged extra 500 But they should Good earphones lyk sony ! Overall m happy wid the buy !",

The one challenge i have faced is that the battery takes far too long to charge. It took over 3.5 hours to go from 30% to 100%, and also the charger that comes with the kit heats up quite a bit during the charging process. I hope that this issue is fixed in future batches.",

Launched a complaint..and got it replaced by Thursday 11th September. Hats off to the Flipkart Delivery system, because getting your product replaced is not so easy through online platforms. Anyways. about the phone.. PROS : 1. Excellent display - The screen is crisp and all colours look lively. You won't complain about the screen at all. 2. The Stereo Speakers - Great sound quality, better than the earlier gen. of Moto G, you would definitely enjoy playing games and watching videos. 3. The Camera - Good camera, fast focusing, great flash. Overall the camera is really good at this price point. 4. Updates - Motorola has already confirmed that this phone would get the Android L update, so chill :'D 5. Build Quality - The curved back gives an awesome feel to your hands and makes it easy for you to hold. 6. Battery - I basically used my phone for browsing (45 min), Games (20 min), Watching videos (20 min), social messaging (25 min) and listening to music for 2 hrs..And surprisingly, I got battery backup of 20hr+..So it's great, at least for me. CONS: 1. The camera could have been better in terms of sharpness. But it won't be a deal breaker for you. 2. The RAM and Processor can be a problem for some of the people At the end, I would suggest you guys to buy this phone if want a nice stylish phone at this price + a branded and reliable company like Motorola. So just GO FOR IT!",

To switch off the flash, need to restart the mobile and open the camera app. No issues when flash is set to off. All buyers, please do verify your mobiles, as this issue has been spotted in all the mobiles which me n my friends had bought. Try doing this to verify whether your mobile has this problem or not: > Set your camera flash to ON or AUTO mode. > Try to place some piece of paper which had some text in it and put the paper very close to camera. (very little gap between ur phone and the paper) > Try taking the pic or try to autofocus. Here the actually issue starts, the mobile tries to focus the text but the flash goes to a hung state. Meanwhile, you can even use ur mobile but flash will be glowing all the time. To switch off the flash, need to restart the mobile and open the camera app. As, i have found this issue in all the devices which me n my friends bought, it might be the issue with the hardware. Apart from this issue, everything works flawlessly. Raised a complaint to Flipkart and asked us to wait till we get a call from technical team. Tried calling mutliple times to call center, they need 24 business hours( 3 days ) to just know the details about the issue. God knows when do they really start knowing about the issue and start working on it :(",

Pros: 1) 5 inch screen. the older version in smaller. good for people looking for a big cellphone. 2) Battery. It helps me go through out the day without charging. my daily usage is mostly moderate with frequent use of WiFi, 3G, good use of camera, and small games like Minion Rush or Quiz Up. Even with all these running whole day, the battery stays above the critical level. It takes a bit to charge to the full limit but even 60 percent is enough to get through the day. 3) Speaker. Two Speakers and stereo effect. Loved this feature. watching movies and videos with friends doesnt take much effort now. everything is audible even in a busy room. 4) Multitasking. Apps run smoothly with other running in backgroud. 5) Memory Slot. finally! thank you motorola! 6) Dual sim. well, i am using one right now. 7) Looks. Great. Fits well in hand. and Looks very rich for its price. 8) Camera: 8mp with 2mp secondary. both work well. took a few pics. the focus works good in the primary cam. secondary cam is a bit shaky, but i guess thats my fault because i am not used to clicking through the front cam. 9) Android L coming soon (excited) Cons: 1) Pixel density is still the same as previous model. this is not a big issue, as the display is still crisp and great. this shouldnt be a problem. everything looks great. i dont think you will find anything like this at this price.",

I Ordered Moto G Gen 2 in the midnight of 6th Sept and product was received at Indore Hub on 7th Sept but since 8th their logistics partner E-kart commit us to deliver this product by the day end and then no attempt is made. Even regularly I am following up with their so called customer care department and those stupid people are so clueless that they are not able resolve the issues and just exchanging mails with corny content with no intention of customer satisfaction. Today I cancelled my order and decided to not to use Flipkart in future. Flipkart should understand that if they will not care for customers customers will not take time to forget them.",

Cons: Flipkart should have started selling Flip covers for the new Moto G. Presently, Flipcovers for new Moto G 2nd are not available in the shops too. Further, there is no USB cable and Screen Guard included in the Pack. Also wanted to know if there is any Motorola connectivity software connecting and transferring files, Pics, SMS, etc between PC and phone.",

Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :) I am using this product since yesterday I received and I charged my mobile yesterday in the evening still 62% battery is there. I am using the net on wifi mode, listening music, receiving calls, Whatsapp, playing Subway surfers. Now I can say that the battery backup is excellent. Even the Charger is not heating while charging. So guys whos charger is getting heat up while charging kindly get it change from flipkart. Camera performance is much much better than the old Moto G. While Playing games it never hangs so I can say the processor is also good as compare to all the samsung phones having 1 GB or Ram in that it hangs while playing game. I even played asphalt 8.0 and it is working great. Regarding the look and feel I cant keep myself away. I just love holding on my hand its very light. If you come to the screen resolution you cannot say that its 720P or 1080P until you go through the Specification. The content is sharp and clear. The sound is very loud and clear, even while attending a call or making a call there is no noise disturbance, the word spoken is very clear to me as well as to the receiver. Even the headphone sound is very loud and clear. While talking I didn't find any network drop. Last but not the least Apple user don't waste your money on such product whose cost is 6 times more and giving 2012 specification.",

First Impression is the Last Impression - The speed, the hand-feel and the buttery touch will make you smile the moment you switch it on. The big screen is indeed a wonderful update to the good ol' Moto G 1st Gen 2. Setting you up - This phone configures/personalizes all your stuff within minutes. Google is indeed biased towards its product. 3. Camera - I am a photographer, and trust me, though people may start comparing this phone with its immediate competitor Micromax Canvas Nitro (which has a 13 MP & 5 MP camera), I would say don't get wooed by megapixels. This phone's camera has a pretty decent sensor. 4. Memory too less - Is it? Well, technically yes. 1 GB is definitely not a pro in this multitasking world. But for users like me out there, who love to spend time more on social media, news, comics, magazines and other similar things, this phone will not disappoint you. 5. Battery - A small problem indeed since now you have a powerful screen to touch with the same 1st Gen battery. However, with the right apps and usage (and I don't mean you won't play games or not browse the internet), you can pretty much make it last for 24 odd hours. 6. Storage - Looks pretty decent to me. I am never going to cross 48 GB (16 GB + 32 GB MicroSD) anyway. 7. Size, bulkiness, weight - This is a very light, slim and easily-comes-in-the-pocket phone. I have short fingers, so I got to use both hands for operation. 8. EDGE/Wi-Fi - Can't really update you on 3G, but EDGE and Wi-Fi experience has been good so far. I got it on 9th September. Still a new user, and hence will keep sharing my experiences here in the days to come. However, I would strongly suggest you to buy this over any other phone in this range.",

Coming to the specifications of the Moto G 2nd Generation: 1.The box contains accessories like the charger and the headphones (not worth it). Use headphones like Sony, JBL, etc, the music is really superb. The charger is not a USB mounted charger. So please ensure to have your own USB cable for data transfer. 2.The phone is very slim compared to the earlier Moto G and it is very light in weight when thinking of any other 5\" smartphone. 3.The looks and design of the phone are worth appreciating. The Clear Black Body with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and the Black Matt finish at the bottom, feels to keep it in hand for hours and hours. The resolution of the screen is HD. 4.The display of the phone is very crisp and sharp, the wide angle display is also good. the pixel density is 294 ppi. 5.The phone has 2 speakers, on the front and the output of the sound is very loud and clear. The sound is very high when compared to the sound of the previous version of Moto G. 6.And now the most awaited moment for all the Moto G 2nd Generation buyers, the Motorola team has come up with a variant launched in India, having 16gb internal memory and expandable memory slot upto 32 gb. 7.The camera quality is way way way way way way .... better than the previous version of the Moto G. The 8 mp quality is really good in the natural light and above average in the indoors. The front facing camera is decent with a 2 mp. The video resolution is HD. 8.The advantage of buying this phone is that the Google has already announced that it would be having the next Android Update of LOLLIPOP, Android L for this phone. It comes with the Kitkat version of 4.4.4 and with no pre-loaded apps like the other smart phones other than two security applications of Motorola. 9. The processor is an improved version compared to the previous version, it comes with a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a quad core 1.2 Ghz. The phone does not lag playing the games like asphalt 8, Dead Trigger, Nova 3 etc. There is no extreme heating when playing these high graphic games. The phone gets little warm, which normally would happen. 10.It has a led notification light for all the notification lovers, 11.The disappointment comes when the battery is considered, the battery is same 2070 mah, which should had been at least 2500 to 2700 mah. The only cons of this phone, but as far as an android phone is concerned, we all travel with our chargers and power banks. So its not a big concern. 12.All people concerned about the care centers for Motorola, it has got its centers in all most all states So, overall I would conclude, the best priced phone for a STOCK Android phone along with the delivery of the Flipkart makes it a SURE SHOT BUY. Thank you Google and Motorola.... and Flipkart ...",

About the product (no specs) - speakers: They have provided 2 speakers but the sound isnt great or twice as loud. you will have to keep your hands to the side instead of back for better sound. - battery: Battery is hmm just about ok, they should have increased the battery capacity considering its a 5 inch phone. - screen: 5 inch makes sense as it doesnt have dedicated buttons and stock android has the buttons on the screen using some space of its own. - look and feel: great. feels lighter than older moto g. back panel is richer in quality. overall a pretty good looking device. hope its as sturdy as appears. - accessories : headphones/charger. for the price they are ok. - storage: and as my title.. am super happy with the huge storage capacity (internal + plus sd). - no lag whatsoever also am happy with the boot up time. - rear camera is good for a mid range mobile phone. front camera exceeds expectation, definitely good for video calls. final comment: super phone.",

            "comment": "very nice smart phone under 14k. 1. Larger screen: The new Moto G looks almost the same as the old one, but has a slightly bigger screen. The new model has a display larger than the old model by 0.5 inches but with the same screen resolution. The 5-inch 720p display on the new Moto G produces good colours and has satisfactory viewing angles. The larger screen with the same screen resolution means a lower pixel density, but practically, there is little difference for a naked eye to notice. 2. Improved cameras: The Moto G (2nd generation) comes with enhanced cameras. The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upped from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera, and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera. I remember telling people in review of the original Moto G earlier this year that the front camera is okay only for video calling, but not for selfies. But now Motorola has filled that gap with the new model. 3. Additional storage: A significant improvement in the second-gen Moto G is that it offers expandable storage. The addition of a microSD card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously. The original Moto G was criticised for not offering additional storage. The company recommends to use a microSD card of not more than 32GB. 4. Dual speakers: Unlike the old Moto G that came with a speaker grill at the back, the new Moto G has dual speakers at the front that produce fairly loud sound in a normal room environment. However, in a noisy atmosphere, it may not sound as powerful. But with earphones plugged in, the phone produces excellent audio results. 5. Cheaper: Motorola in its new Moto G has upped the specs on many fronts, but what it has not increased is its price - in fact, the phone gets slightly cheaper. The new and improved Moto G (16GB) comes at a price of Rs 12,999, which is Rs 1000 cheaper than its predecessor. (The company has not yet launched the 8GB varaint of the new Moto G.)",

So if anyone who needs a phone under Rs.15000/- can go for it. Voice clarity is good while on call, speaker voice is good and clear, phone is fast and moreover now you can install SD card in it too.

When imagination and expectation perfectly matches reality...welcome Moto G2...its a dream come true!!! If smart phones can't offer basic features like wider screen , expandable memory through microSD, FM , Stereo speakers , pure Vanilla flavour of Android with smooth buttery performance and latest firmware upgrade and still cost up to 30-50k... These basic features have become a necessity and not just a luxury or something to just brag about unnecessarily. But if the same is available at economical price without compromising on the premium finish looks..then u know you have made the right decision. Rather Motorola has made it much simpler by adding more features to Moto G (1st gen) and reducing price of 2nd gen phone by 1000 bucks. My previous smartfone costed me 23k and I retained it for 2 yrs 8 mnths and ever since I bought it, I have been using Android 2.3- Not a single firmware upgrade I received!! Which was bad !!! From the past 1 yr I have been looking to buy a much matured smartfone and that too @ economical price. Finally the wait is over !!! Screen width is better compared to Moto G (1st gen) and matches that of Nexus 4, Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S4, and Samsung Grande Duos. So feel good abt it. I wish the in-box accessories also contained a data cable- with USB charging adapter instead of just a single piece of charger. Overall I would say full satisfaction with the product.... 100 out of 100.",

The phone specifications given are exactly whats being said and it really amazes the way it is. I wont say the Price is cheaper compared to the quality of the product. It is reasonably priced with the quality of the phone is. The Pros: 1) 5 inch Screen which is very easy to handle and it is really needed with today's usage of bigger screen, also the screen is Corning Gorilla Glass, which is essential in todays rough treatments with our Phones....lol.. 2) Phones Camera (8 MP as primary and 2 MP as Front for Selfie), it shoots really awesome pics with good resolution of 1280 X 720 and also the Video as well. Front camera works really great with better and brighter pics. 3) Speakers, Dual speakers works really great. The sound is crispy and loud from both the speakers and when used the headset really good and entertaining which will keep you busy listening to music for hours. 4) Light Weight of the phone makes it really easy to handle and its really compact and easy to use with one hand operation (of course u cant play games using one hand) but yes. 5) Dual Sim slot, and very big addition of this phone is its Memory Card expansion slot, which is like a BOON to these category of models of phone with Premium Brands. 6) Better phone in compact size compared to other 4.7 inch screen phone also against its predecessor models of Moto G and Moto X. The Cons: 1) Biggest and Baddest Con if i say is its Battery Usage, its really a Power Greedy phone (The reason power greedy because last night i charged the phone with 80% and went to sleep keeping the phone beside me, and in the morning when i woke up and saw the battery level is showed me 10% remaining (i slept for almost 6 1/2 hours) so you can imagine the consumption of power is made in those unused hours in the night. 2) The Headset model provided with the phone are really obsolete ones. Everybody wants those noise cancellation with ear buds Headsets. Its really a cheap move made in Motorola quality (well we are even priced likewise), anyone can buy a new separate headsets with those noise cancellation ear buds and which will cost you around 1000 bucks, well it can be compromised. 3) Hmmm....(thinking).........will get back once i find another one...... BUT overall a good phone to buy for those budget conscious people out there. The wait was worth it and i am really satisfied with the product if i compare it with the price i paid.. Enjoy the phone....somethings can be compromised as no phone is perfect and every phone has their own drawbacks but....its good.....",

There is a solution but the problem shouldnt have arised in the first place because I have used the mobile only carefully, so much so that I havent even dropped it down even once. Disappointed. Editing my rating from 5 to 0. Below was my initial review when I bought it. I have been using a phone which was costlier with less features. I can certainly feel the difference. This review is after a days use. 1. Looks: Stylish. The front cover ruins the style. I feel like removing it. Apart from that, the finishing is good. Reasonable weight. The speaker protrusions look ugly. Those could have been in the sides. 4.5/5 2. Screen: Looks good. Gorilla alright. Feather touch sensitive. Not sure why Google increased half an inch. I liked Moto G for this. 4.5/5 3. Usability, memory management: No problems so far. With facebook, facebook messenger, chrome, google plus, hangouts, angry birds etc running, I still have 300mb free memory. 4. Audio: Sound is good. Quality not deserving a 5 star rating because I hear some grains. 4.5/5 5. Video: Expected Full hd videos to lag. But they played just fine. 5/5 6. OS: I miss a smaller font and a better resolution. But a better resolution and a better battery would make it Moto X. Google Now is awesome. But have to open it and click the record button to record voice. But voice recognition is amazing. No FM recording or call recording. 4.3/5 Battery performance: Practice every conservation methods like reducing brightness, turn off wifi/data when not in use, motorola assist, and you should be fine for 20-24 hours. Camera: Back cam is superb! So is the front. Misses photo modes. Packaging: Small neat package. An earphone, a charger inside. They could have given a free back cover and a cleaning cloth IMO. Altogether, Job well done by Google.",

I had doubt on its battry performance but even after using for whole day with heavy usage it last for whole day. Pros: Camera: Excellent Body: build is very good and that two speaker in front gives you a very nice look. Performance: As there is no change in Processor and ram, speed is similar to Moto g . This is already trademark as excellent :) Display: Quality is very good, tried watching some HD movies and its excellent. SD Card: I have put 32 GB card which is 26 GB full and thought that performance will be reduced but it is running very smooth. Cons: Inbuilt headphone is not up to the mark. Motorola should work on its accessories. Overall it\u2019s a very very good product at this price. Go for it",

Coming on the product, After using it for 3 days, I can say that you wont get better phone with a brand name and quality within this price range or even 4-5k more than this price. The camera is awesome, display is crisp with no pixelation even when you put your eyes nearer to the screen. Front speakers are just excellent, No heating problem, no lagging, nice hold and design. Become a fan of Moto. Welcome back. :)",

Some of its main advantages are: 1) The phone is really good and looks decent enough. 2) It is fast for the hardware used in the phone credited to the stock android 3) It is very light weight and handy and the back panel is really really good. 4) The back Panel is so good that you don't want to keep it down. 5) The screen is bright enough and the picture quality and sound quality is very decent The drawback with this phone are: 1) Poor battery backup 2) Stock accessories supplied with the phone. 3) The earphones are normal earphones and are not comfortable to use. 4) The charger is useless. It short circuited my entire house when I plugged it in for the first time because it was too lose to fit in a normal sized power socket. 5) Next it is extremely slow to charge the phone took nearly 6 hours to completely charge it from 11%. 6) Finally don't touch the charger after charging for 2 hours or so. You might burn your fingers its that hot.",

Coming to the Phone, Here are the pros 1)The best best phone when it comes to performance, works like butter, already downloaded 7GB of games on the phone but still works as fast as lighting. No slugging while playing games like Asphalt 8, Real Racing3, Robocop, Iron Man 3, Front line 2. 2)The rear camera is cool, captures the detailing with the focus option, front is great for selfless. 3) Sound quality is awesome with its full stereo sound, feels great while playing games and watching videos with out the head fones. 4) Display quality, having a 5inch display gives you more detailing with the videos and games with a sharp display. Cons: There are no cons in the Phone but in the accessories. 1) The head fone could have been a bit better. 2) The charger heats up very fast while charging the phone. My rating will be 5 for 5 . Guys this Phone is a value for money, buy it before the stocks are out.;)",

Booked it on the 6th at midnight and got delivered on 9th (due to holidays and the craphole iam living in). Great effort from flipkart, and about phone,.. You wont get a descent phone with all these features from a reliable company at this rate.. MOTO is a trust. Thats what it makes different from other chinese or Indian manufactures. Phone is excellent. 5'' display above the 4.5'' of moto g. slightly lower ppi. but u wont recognize with ur naked eyes. CRISP, SHARP and Vibrat but not oversaturated.. Premium buit. Thin, and u have to hold it in ur hand to feel it.. just awesome.. 2 Stereo speakers out in front.. provides cristal clear sound without any distortion at max volume.. Attention Grabbing look. seriously. Expecially the black one.. The only problem was I felt was The Charger provided in the pack is crap. earphone is OK, but not in-ear. Battery backup is kind of low.. but lasts a day for me without any problem in normal usage.. CAM is ok.. 8mp cam provides descent clarity images..which also suports panorama, HDR, and 1080p video and slowmotion.. I recomend this phone for everyone who need a budget phone from a great company.. Dont go for the chinese over this.. they wont last long and u will regret later.. (happend to me)",

Flipkart has refunded me the entire amount. But my misfortune, that particular model is out of stock in Flipkart. So I waited for almost one week and Moto G 2nd Gen launched on the last Saturday. Without any doubt I ordered it on the first day and as always Flipkart delivered it to me within no time. So regarding the service of Flipkart, its always 5/5. Now coming back to Moto G, awesome phone. The first look itself is stunning, great finish and very much handy. Although the screen size is 5 inch, it doesn't feel big on your hands. The build quality is excellent. The looks are better than Asus Zenfone 5. As of now I have installed most of the apps that I use frequently and the phone is not lagging. The screen is ultra clear. The camera is good. 8MP is providing a good clarity and even the front cam too. The battery back up is pretty good. Infact the battery backup is far better than Asus Zenfone 5. The front speakers are a great advantage on the new Moto G. Its loud and clear. The signal strength and wifi capturing is better compared to Zenfone 5. So I dont regret now. Moto G 2nd Gen is far better than Asus Zenfone 5. Although the Asus UI is better. But Moto G is already updated to latest KitKat version. (preinstalled) The dual sim functionality is good and the micro sd card slot is definitely a breakthrough compared to the Moto G 1st Gen. Overall I will give 5 out of 5 for the new Moto G.",

            "comment": "This 2nd Generation~Moto G is really a worthy successor of Moto G(old).. with a micro SD card slot, beautiful 5\" inch display, more pixel density and 8MP camera .. Design is also fabulous... Some hours ago, I was actually thinking to buy Xperia T2 ultra or HTC 816,as my preferences were: 1. More than 5\" screen.. 2. Good camera with flash, with secondary camera.. 3. Dual sim.. 4. Nice touch and HD display.. 5. Durability, good battery backup and cutting-edge technology.. and last but not the least, 6. Brand value and good service support.. Though I intended not to exceed my budget more than 20k, because for me its no use to spend more than 20k only over a phone.. That's why I was in a great dillema..!! Here, Moto-G(old) was already a blip-blip sensation to me, because of its great performance and pocket-friendly price, but the two main cons were: 1. No external sd card support 2. Small screen And see, in the 2nd generation phone, these two drawbacks have been totally eradicated.. You can never expect this kind of features in this budgets actually.... Hence, why to wait for? See me... As soon as I had seen the advertisement, I booked it instantly without thinking of a second.... :) :) CONS: Actually I haven't found any con's in the device so far >> 1. Camera is good at day time but not so premium at low lights.. 2. Battery performance is not out of the world.. 3. The supplied head-phone is a so-so typed.. Mmm, that's all.. Actually there's no any defects I have found yet..!!! Indeed, the smartphone is Double worthy for the money. I will say, just get it without any hesitation.. Really its very nice of this price.. Anyways, I will keep posting my experience with the device in the coming weeks.. And yeah, Flipkart again proved that he's the best.... Have placed the order just yesterday evening and received by 10am PM today! Imagine..!! Just within 15 hrs, I got my product.. Really, FK makes the impossible possible... Amazing..!!! *kudos*",

Design- Outstanding look..with a sleek back cover and it is easy to hold in both hands( one or both). You must fill that it worth far than it's original price. I prefer the black one..coz it looks fabulous with such a big screen. 2. Performance- Actually I am searching a phone which have the capability of doing multitasking with smoothness and I bet you that till now it has all those which will give you a proper satisfaction. 3. Camera- I must say that it is the thing which makes me WONDER..because I heard reviews before I order. So I knew that it has a very optimized and cool camera with flash. I found it so easy because you can simply click on anywhere on the screen to capture photos. I have also testes the it with flash and I saw that it is very good. 4. Sound- Moto G2 has dual speakers in FRONT which will give you a fabulous soothing experience. While you play any game,videos the sound will not be pampered by your hand. 5. Others- It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor which give you a lagfree experience of playing games and doing multitasking. I installed Asphalt 8 and my experience was superb. Thank you Flipkart and Motorola for delivering and making me happy. :)",

After using phone for couple of days I can say that this is a phone worth buying. 5 inch screen, expandable memory, dual front speakers, 8MP rear camera and 2 MP front camera surely put this in one of the top contenders in Mid range android phone Market. The issue which I have experienced so far is with the battery. It drains out much faster than the previous version and other android phone in this range. If it could have been a bit better this could have been easily a sensation in android phone market. The other which I could highlight is, it dint come with a data cable but that something I think we can live with. Overall,If you can live with the battery issue this phone is worth every single penny.",

Now today they have initiated the replacement. Let us see how the replaced piece will be. I will give a further update on this after i receive the replacement.

Also, it is the only company which doesn't add lame prefixes and suffixes beside the names of their phones to show the so called 'update of specs'. Pros: 1. The biggest improvement is the build quality of the phone. I'm blown away by the beauty of this 5-inch \"smart\"phone! It looks even better than many of the 20-25k phones, which I totally didn't expect! 2. The battery life (amazingly) lasts more than 'a day and a half' upon moderate usage! 3. The camera is beautiful as well and has lovely settings. No cons as of now..the phone is just flawless! (which is exactly what we can expect from Google) It is worth every paisa which you pay. Don't wait for shitty invites or so called 'stock' of other brands to arrive. GO FOR IT!",

Accessories included Charger And Earphones. Earphones looks quite cheap. The quality of sound is not that good also. they look like some 300rs cheap earphones Except that the phone looks very stylish and feels very comfortable in hands. Pros: 1. It looks very good, display is very nice, bright and bit high saturated colours looks great. Videos looks amazing. As the display is of 5 inches, youtube videos looks great and websites show complete content, you dont have to scroll up and down too much. 2. I have noticed that speakers are quite improved from older moto g, voice is very loud and crisp, voice doesnt get crack even if you play a high pitched noisy video on full volume. sound is very stable. 3. It comes with 4.4 kitkat preinstalled. each and every application runs very smoothly even if you have many application running in the background, it doesnt even show 1% lag in scrolling or running any app. I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phone and it runs very very smoothly. 4. Camera on this device is of 8 megapixel. and secondary camera is of 2 megapixel, i must say both the cameras works brilliantly. Hdr mode really works good. i have made a skype call to my friend and outgoing video was really good as my frnd told. i have took many selfies which are quite good looking and doesnt show any lack of quality. 5. Voice calls were very clear and sharp. the audio quality was very good and noise reduction works seemlessly. The people with whom you are talking to can hear you clearly in a noisy environment. 6. Again the main advantage in this new moto g is sd card support, which is amazing. you can use the whole internal memory of phone for installing games and applications and your videos and audio files can be stored in sd card which is ofcourse a great advantage. 7. I have charged this phone 4-5 times till now and it doesnt get heated up. it stays cool even if you play games along with charging. Although it is not suggested to run heavy applications with charging, but who cares lol. CONS: 1. At first i would say, motorola should consider that the earphones that they are giving with this phone should be good as the headphones are not good, and the sound quality of earphones are not good at all. 2. As soon i turned this phone on, i have connected the device with my wifi to check for software updates n more but whenever i check for updates it says. \"Cant check for updates right now, Try later\" I think there must be some server error of anything. Thats it. i couldnt find anything more as a drawback of a negative point to my experience. So, i would say the phone is really good. looks smart, stylish with great performance and all the new features. Motorola guarantees the update of L android platform which will be released by google in future.",

Great service by Flipkart!!!!! Haven't had a long experimentation with the device however, the Phone handles really well. Primary camera is great, infact better than my digital camera. The phone feels and fits really good in the hands. It seems lighter than the 149 gms that the specs mention. I had a little difficulty in removing the back cover for the first time. Thought it would break if i applied any more strength to it. However the user manual that came along helped. In fact they do mention in the manual to be generous in applying a little pressure. Moto G2 uses a micro sim, so I had to cut my existing mini sim in order to use it in the phone. Overall a great experience so far with the phone and Flipkart.",

The Moto G (2nd Gen) has everything what needs to be part of the actual \"SMART\" phone. Good feeling, Good navigation, Superb screen display, Awesome sound quality, good screen size, fast processing of apps, etc., I love the service from Flipkart.com , as they delivered next day although i have selected standard delivery. Now i am happy to part of Moto(rola) family :)",

Expansion option is the key missing thing in previous gen which is addressed now. 4. Tried watching a few Google Play movies, the experience is pretty good. 5. When you keep the WiFi and 3G off, the battery is pretty good. Tried charging 100% yesterday night and kept it aside with WiFi connectivity on, for a good 8 hours the battery went down to 65%. Charged it again in the morning and turned off the WiFi, checked that the charge is same after 1hr 30min. If you want to go with standard, this is the best in this price range.. If you are behind UI, this is not your piece, but you will definitely loose future OS updates if you don't opt for this.. Raghu",

            "comment": "EDIT - After about 6-7 months of use, I can say that the performance is very good. But, the power button on my unit has become smushy and very hard to press. Multiple visits to the service centre (They were really not good) and calls to Motorola and Flipkart were of no use (They simply suggested me to visit the service centre again). I'm left to live with the fact that the button can fail any time. Also, i feel buying the phone on the launch day was a mistake, since the first phones off the assembly tend to have slight problems which get fixed later. I'm left jealous with the quality of my friends' Moto Gs construction. Amazing smartphone from Motorola, that too just at 13k! Finally upgraded from my Motorola Defy+, the experience on the Moto G is much more fluid than on my old phone. Pros: 1. The screen is sharp and even though it seems huge, its pretty compact for its size. 2. Everything runs smoothly and snappily. No lag whatsoever (so far). 3. The inclusion of a microSD card slot was a big plus for me, as i could transfer everything without even using Moto Migrate, which by itself is a great feature. 4. Camera is a 8MP unit, but low light photos aren't very good. But hey, for this price point it's really great. 5. Another big plus is the bloat-free KitKat. 6. For those concerned about SAR, the SAR values for this phone are below the DoT recommendation. Cons: Nothing so far, (hopefully) won't find any. One thing to mention is non-removable battery, but it's easy to live with. So the 2nd gen Moto G ticks all the boxes this time, I was really surprised to see the price of this phone.",

Though there are others products like Micromax. xolo, lava n all are available as a competitor of this product but I feel this is best of all. It has snapdragon 400 quad core processor which separates this out from all other brands. But there are few things which I didn't like personally and I feel I would have done better: 1. Battery: 2070 mAh compare to 2000 mAh battery in moto g. 2. Dual speaker : Bad idea, as it was destroying the look of set. 3. Front camera is 2MP comapre to 1.6 MP in Moto g. It could be improved too. Overall I would say, it is a worth buying product. I am rating it 4/5 becoz of battery.",

            "comment": "-0.5 star for HIGH SAR VALUE -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade Initially, I rated 3 stars, now I increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery backup after the lollipop update. The updated review is at end, so please read till end of the review.. Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 , Nexus 7, Spice dream Uno, I have owned Xiaomi Mi3, Galaxy Grand, Xperia ZL, Lumia 525, Canvas 2 colors, Sony LWW n MOTO E.. so I have fair amount of knowledge about these electronic Gadgets and I am a gadgets freak..... THIS REVIEW IS FOR A NEUTRAL PERSON WHO IS CONFUSED FOR WHICH MOBILE TO CHOSE in the midrange segment. PROS: 1) Its Motorola 2) Screen is bright and vivid 3) Best stock android phone under Rs 15000 4) Camera in daylight 5) Nice grip 6) Speakers somewhat CONS: 1) Camera in night 2) Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level 3) Requires too much time for charging SCREEN : The screen is pretty nice one.. I like its vividness.. Seriously my Mi3 didn't had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Asus zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it.. No problems with the screen Performance:- CAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a 13k phone, my canvas 2 colors' 8mp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one.. The images appear blurry and lost focused.. The mi3 camera is very good. GAMING:- This is the place where it hits the sweet spot.. It is lil bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3.. You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two.. SPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit.. So they are better than the competition at this price but not the best... And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's stereo speakers.. HTC's speakers are way too superior to those.. Headset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820... (I own a sennheiser , skullcandy titan ,Skullcandy Ink'd 2, Mi ear phones and Creative ep 630 sony MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..) CALL CLARITY AND \"SAR\" VALUE:- The call clarity is good but not excellent.. The best call clarity among the mobiles I used until now is from HTC Desire 820... When I bought the phone, the SAR values mentioned on flipkart website were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page.. And I was UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SAR VALUE ON THE BOX AS WELL AS PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO MENTION THE SAR VALUE ON PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING TO INDIAN REGULATIONS.. I bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola... I feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY. My 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality product. I have owned Mi3 and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone. FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G 2nd gen TO BE ON PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobiles like me, will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise.. It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition. End result: Friends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at YU Yureka or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money.. And lastly, if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G 2nd gen. UPDATED 20/02/2015: After the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more, or should I say far more... The entire experience after the update is very very good... But as compared to Mi3, its still below par.. But as Mi3 sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone 5, it seems moto g2 is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto g2 is being used by my dad.. Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update... Other than that, the phone is smooth as butter.. Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handler for the lollipop update.. So overall, I will strongly recomment others to go with moto g2 ( after lollipop update only) if they are looking for proper balance of performance, design and software.. I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire... Thank You for reading this.. Will update soon as per the experiences..",

It doesn't last more than 2 hours if the Mobile data is switched on. For the volume of the calls I Handle, the battery ends only half day and I have to continuously keep it for charging. Very Hot: Phone is heating up like a hot oven if the call is carried for 5 minutes plus, almost burning my ears. Touch Screen: During charging, the touch screen does not work. All other keys open some other application during charging. Connectivity: The calls gets disconnected abruptly in-between. Sometime the other person says, he is not able to hear anything. Speakers: The headset is not up to the mark, even the loud speakers are very bad. Call quality is not good and cannot hear anything. Finally I am very dejected with the battery performance. for the kind of processor speed they have given a absolute useless battery. I am feeling like a BMW 5 series car fitted with a Nano Engine.",

Therefore, one doesn't feel it is only a 13k phone. Pros: everyone knows. Personally I feel the best phone with some features which can be corrected. Cons: Ram is 1 GB, it may not sound like a con but if you add the used RAM and free RAM the total comes to 852 MB which far less than 1GB (1024 MB). (of which more than 350 MB is already occupied RAM so you only get 500 MB for your own use) I have checked lava iris x1, Rs. 7600 phone provides you with 950 MB in 1GB of RAM so what happened with Moto G. Last time they sold more than a million Moto G so for calculating how many GBs they are saving by saving just 100 MB on one phone. 1000000 x 100 MB = 100000 GB of money (one lakh GB of money) Second thing: The scroll down of Moto G is like empty. The most basic thing which one uses is the \"profile\". like the phone sound is on General, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor but it does not have that option neither in the scroll down section nor in the settings. Normally if you go to the setting => Profile => General, Silent, Meeting or Outdoor and choose one of them to customize the settings. But in Moto G, Setting=> Sound. No option for Profile, general, Silent, meeting or outdoor. (Big problem) So the only solution is press the on/off button then change the sound to \"silent\", \"vibrate\" or general\" but no option to edit these settings. I am playing Asphalt 8 on this phone. Good but sometimes it crashes. So not so good. Therefore, overall it\u2019s a 5 star rating phone comparing the price it is available at. Only thing they need to do is correct the problems mentioned above.",

            "comment": "I was excited to receive my new phone, especially as an upgrade from my horribly sluggish and erratic Samsung S-duos. The phone itself is a good looking piece. I was originally not happy with the 5inch screen, having always preferred the smaller sub 4.5inch phones, but I quickly started to enjoy the extra screen real estate. My biggest issue with this phone has been the miserable battery performance. I gave it a full charge soon as it arrived and that charge lasted about 6 hours of usage! Anyway, I then disabled GPS, reduced screen brightness, and now a full overnight charge is lasting me about 7-8 hours at normal usage. It takes only 3 hours to go from 100% to 50% with usage of 3g, a few phone calls, some whatsapp messaging. That just cannot work for my lifestyle! The other issue that I noticed right from day 1 which frightened me is that the touchscreen sometimes does not respond. Particularly when it is plugged in to charge. Not just does it not respond, but it acts very erratic. So when it is having such an episode, it presses buttons randomly, does not recognize your finger, etc. I have had this happen about 3-4 times in the first two days, though it has not done that again since. It worries me to have a phone showing such serious issues right in the first week of usage, and makes me not trust it as a device that is so important in my life. I dont know if it is my particular piece that is defective, or whether this model itself is a bad choice. I am returning my phone for these reasons. 8 hours of battery is just not acceptable for a lifestyle on the move. Too bad, coz I was starting to really like the phone. :(",

I know if i maintain control over usage of RAM by apps, i should not face this issue, but there is too much trouble involved with going to apps and tweaking their settings. I got my girlfriend to purchase a Nokia Lumia 625 a little before i had purchased this phone, and I am pleasantly surprised that with only a 512MB RAM that phone has not hung even a single time. So if u plan to buy a phone and use it only for around 3-4 months then i would suggest you purchase any android device! Else go for windows!",

There was no motorola's M mark on it plus the sheet was lifted a bit plus their was couple dirt bubbles on the set. Am also not sure if motorola or flipkart will be sure even about which lot is fresh. it might be some returned repackaged set. Update to earlier review above - Got the handset replaced on 26/11/14. And thankfully this time it was a fresh piece. Gotta watch its battery performance now. The charger is still heating up though!! Update after a week of using the replaced handset - The battery is VERY BAD. It doesn't even last 24 hrs!! This phone deserves a ZERO STAR RATING.",

Problems: 1. The touch sensitivity is very poor and many a times stops working completely and you have to reboot the phone to get back to normal 2. The phone freezes a lot and performance is laggy and slow 3. The dual speakers heat up a lot and you can't touch the earpiece(one of the speakers) after playing music out loud for more than 15-20 minutes 4. The RAM is too less and only around 300 MB is free at any point which is insufficient for multitasking and apps keep reloading Lot of other small problems but these are the main ones. i would strictly recommend against buying this phone. Don't get carried away with your impression of the first gen device as i did. P.S : I understand that this may be a batch issue in which case Motorola should proactively recall the faulty devices to avoid further losses in customer value",

Motorola should pump up its quality function to avoid such issues. I bought this phone with lot of excitement but was disappointed completely. Since I got 2 replacement i.e. I used 3 different devices, I find it hard to digest this as a one-off case. My experience is as follows: Lot of positive reviews on the Flipkart and numerous media reports strongly recommending MOTO G (2nd Gen) as one of the best devices in its price range made the purchase decision easy for me. 22nd Sept | Phone reached us in no time through the one-day delivery option. 29th Sept | The phone worked flawlessly for a week before the display conked off. Immediately a return/replacement request was filed with Flipkart which was addressed and accepted immediately and the replacement phone reached us the very next day. The return request was denied at this point in time by Flipkart and I cannot complain as this is mentioned on the Moto G page on the Flipkart site. 7th Oct | During a week\u2019s usage of this phone I could sense that the screen has yellow tint on the screen. In fact it was clearly evident when the brightness was set as low. The screen display quality was really disturbing specially because the phone is known for its display. Hence I again requested for a replacement/return. This was also entertained and accepted immediately. Plus I was offered to return the phone by the Flipkart executive, however I chose to give them another chance hoping that this is a one-off case. I asked for a 2nd replacement. 20th Oct | Since I was travelling, I requested Flipkart executive to deliver the 2nd replacement on the 20th. . When I got it I noticed the similar issue on the screen of this device as well. Only difference being that on the previous phone, the entire screen was yellow and in the 2nd replacement phone the bottom half of the screen was yellow. I browsed through the net to find that the issue is known and lot of people are facing it. 21st Oct | I requested for an immediate return and finally pick-up happened on the 22nd and soon after I got the refund as well. Thanks to Flipkart for the same. I give a rating of 1 on the scale of 5 to the phone. However good a phone may be, may have the best of specifications, a single factor can still make it unusable. Flipkart gets 4 out of 5. You could have got 5 on 5 if you have provisions of entertaining requests on the delivery date and time. I faced a lot of issues when the 2nd replacement was in transit and I contacted your team through phone/mail multiple times to request for a delivery before a certain day and your team gave nothing but false promises. I have noticed that you team has no influence over this and product gets delivered only as per the schedule mentioned on the website. This is an area where you can improve.",

I ordered Moto G 2nd Generation on Mon, 8th Sep'14 for my wife as her birthday gift on 18th Seo'14. At the time of placing order it showed that faster delivery is not available in Guwahati, so, will be delivered by 19th. I requested Filpkart to deliver it on or before 18th. Thanks to Mr. Kethan S from Customer Support of Flipkart who confirmed me that it will be delivered on or before 18th. Flipkart kept their promise and Delhivery delivered the Moto G2 on 18th Sep'14. Many many thanks to Flipkart and Delhivery. Now coming to the product, Motorola has done a great job. The build quality is solid. I felt the premium build quality of Moto G2 as soon as I hold it. The curved design made it one step ahead from the other brands. Pros: 1. Good build 2. Good camera 3. Good battery life (I charged it upto 100% yesterday and still its showing 60%) 4. Gorila Glass helps to use it without screen protector 6. Great display 7. Front speakers are loud n clear 8. No network or call drops 9. Around 12GB available internal memory 10. 5 inch easy to handle with Single hand Cons: 1. Stock Android 4.4.4 UI is not that much user friendly compared to Samsung Touchwiz UI. So many user friendly shortcuts and options are not available which can be found even in low budget Samsung Android phones. 2.The charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone. 3. Headphone is not good. 4. File Manager not found. You have to download third party file manager app. 5. My phone color is black and I got white colored headset. It looks awkward when I wear headset. 6. FM radio not playable through the speakers Overall a great buy from Flipkart for dual sim functionality, great looks and functionality at budget. Since it has few cons... I gave four stars",

Performance though better than Moto g (1st gen.) and also by antutu , but actually its not good. 3. Can't handle to many apps at once. 4. Look wise Moto g (1st gen.) is good. 5. Screen resolution is worst, with increase in screen size it is must to increase the resolution which motorola as failed to do. 6. Price to high compared to competitors. 7.Verdict:- If u love stock rom and pure android experience than go for it, other wise redmi 1s is \"The best phone\"",

When I saw it carefully, i noticed there is a gap between screen and the body on the left side. Clearly its a damaged piece. The finish is not proper. Also there are few other issues, like volume button on the right is very hard and jamming. Touch is also lagging a bit. Battery is taking long time to charge. I had a word with customer care and was informed that a technical guy would contact me soon. But I haven't heard yet from anyone. The whole purpose of soon delivery has gone. Still I hope my phone is replaced ASAP and the issues are not present in the new piece.",

WORST BATTERY EVER :- to save cost MOTO has designed one of the worst batteries which goes out in less than 6 hours 2. WORST CHARGER :- It takes 5 hours to charge the phone, are u kidding me ? I bought another charger to see if atleast that charges faster but no, the serial bus of MOTO G is different. 3. Functionality issues like shortcuts, UI are way too primitive than 2012 phones, you really have to click 2-3 times to get to one feature 4. Data transfer is a big pain, firstly they dont give you a USB chord to transfer songs/videos and to make it worse, if you use your normal cable, there is a big issue of drivers and copying files is very unpredictable I have requested for a product return as I invested 13000 so that i dont have to keep this phone plugged to my charger ALL DAY. My advice :- dont buy, go for equal range Sony/Samsung phones, atleast they have some set standards",

It would take a lot of time to get charged to 100 % and the same will be discharged to like 50% in a few hours even though the phone is not at all used (in stand by). After 50 % charge is left on the device the battery will hold on to some time. when the battery is fully charged the discharging is taking place like a count down, whether you use the phone or not. I am not sure whether this issue is because of the stock charger or with the battery but i am strongly request flipkart to do something in this regard as the features of this outstanding phone should not fade away in lime light because of the battery back up.",

From outside everything looked grand. 5\" HD screen, 8MP camera, 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor, 1 GB RAM etc etc. Everything on phone worked fine just like Moto G except for Camera. I kept phone on idle after clicking few pictures on 4x zoom and it stopped responding. The only way to make it work was to restart the phone. It happened 5 times in just 1 hour. This is happening even now. I have already placed the return request for my phone and would not advice anybody to buy Moto G (2nd Gen) phone. Wish I could give it -*****",

This is called Flipkart Monopoly by selling all the stock of earlier edition & for same price just rise by Rs.1000 introduce new edition of Moto G making people fool. Flipkart i think earn Rs.4000 to Rs.5000 per phone. Motorola Moto G Production cost of 1phone may be Rs.8000. Solid way to earn profit & in between that also offering various schemes like cash back on Visa cards etc. to make people fool & sold the product. As far as phone is concern Moto rocks in all aspect other than RAM Thats why for Motorola i am giving 4 Star & for Flipkart i am giving 2 Star & Average star rating 3 Star",

I would like to compare moto g 2 with redmi 1s. Pros moto g: 5\" display (if you like a bigger one) timely android upgrade trusted brand expandable only upto 32gb Pros of redmi 1s: 4.7\" screen ( this is the best optimized size) better camera quality, this has more clear image than moto g better resolution can record videos at resolution 1080 which is not the case with moto g better battery backup, since it has 4.7' screen and both the batteries are almost same. removable battery which is a added advantage. expandable memory upto 64gb fresh UI -> MIUI half the price of moto g Hence decided to go with redmi 1s. But if you are moto fan, need continuous android updates or willing to pay more then plz go with moto g.",

It takes more than 10 hours to charge fully and the battery gets discharged within 3 hours with internet usage (only whatsapp and facebook but not consistently). adding to my pain there is no proper service available for Moto. My suggestion to all those fancy moto phones, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It is worse than cheaper phones in market, I regret buying this phone. I will not buy any phone online, although its cheaper than what you get in the stores but its pain big time. oh one more thing camera too has issues, it says 13 megapixel but the photos are poor and gets blur at corner. I wish Flipkart reads this comments and gets back to me. zero rating from me but it doesnt allow me to post my comment so 1, but it doesnt deserve this as well. Worst ever phone. I hate moto.",

Recently, i got the Xiamoi Mi3 for a relative and used it for a week and that phone is a sure shot bang for the buck. I have become a Xiaomi fan post the same. I have been in comparing the Redmi 1S & Moto G2(yet for one more friend). While Redmi 1S has better specifications undoubtedly but MotoG2 has the following advantages/features i am sold out on using it- 1. Almost Pure Android 4.4 with assured upgrade to Android L. (Redmi1s is modified JB) 2. The back panel is way better/comfortable to hold and has better grip and looks premium. 3. Forget the dimensions, the MotoG2 looks slimmer and elegant. 4. The camera quality(do not go with resolutions only) is definitely a BIG PLUS over its 1st Gen. 5. The dual speakers front speakers are amazing when you listen to video/audio. 6. Though both Redmi 1s/ MotoG2(Lenovo) are Chinese - but the latter looks way better when you flaunting. 7. Bigger screen - and the screen looks real nice. Cons. 1. The battery could have been a little better to support the big crisp display and heavy usage of users these days. 2. \"Ok Google\" is not there directly like in MotoX/Nexus5. Rest 'features' (not specs) are more or less same. So if the criteria is ONLY budget - its Redmi 1S but if its look & feel/ built quality, etc - its HELLO MOTO G2 all the way!!",

Look at the front speakers, the projections are not pleasant at all.It is denting the looks. I compared the screen appearance of both the phones. Original Moto G is superior. Speakers deliver Loud sound but quality is not good. Camera inspite of being 8 Megapixel is not delivering any better pictures.So, to me Moto G ( 2nd Gen. ) is not better in any aspect then original Moto G. Only good thing happened is addition of Micro sd slot. Oh! battery back up is average. Overall a good phone but could have been much better. In future I shall be skeptical in buying a product from Motorola because being a Chienese Co. now. it has inherited what all the Chinese companies are known for, to compromise with quality for keeping the costs low and margins high.",

Previous was 5MP. Now its 8MP. Micro SD slot was added features and experience of the two speaker makes a value to the phone. In this range, its an best option. Bad thing i may face future is of inbuilt battery.Normally in all smartphones after some time of use, Phone gets hanged, only one way to bring the phone back in action is to remove the battery and place it back and switch it on. Here if the phone gets hanged, you have to find a service center or have to wait till the battery get empty. In overall, 7/10, Dynamic 8/10, Camera (in this range) 8/10, Processing speed 8/10.",

So, no need to say about its extremely great looks.(good to show off) Usability is very smooth like cake walk, up to now no lags or hangs etc The Screen Resolution is Very good. I expected that the increase in screen size may pixelate the screen... But the resolution is as clear as mirror. Stereo Speakers: This is a game changer under this price range\u2026Really an excellent addition. The speakers make the design to look sexier\u2026 Camera Clarity also very good. I am able to take some crisp and cool pictures Battery: Yet to test that will post update soon :) Phone weight also very less seems to be lighter than Moto E So people who are considering, Xaiomi or AsusMy recommendation is to just GO FOR MOTO.. U will never regret it",

Giving 1 star just because without giving any star Flipkart will not let me post this review at all. Below is my personal experience : I bought a Moto G 2nd Gen device on 21st June 2015 from Flipkart. After the purchase the device worked fine till the second week. Then I started facing charging related issues with the phone, sometimes the phone was not charging at all and getting heated from the bottom part of the phone. I had given the device for repair at the Nagpur service center \"COWMEN Inf and Tech Pvt Ltd, Empress Mall, Nagpur\". They charged me Rs.1200 for the repair saying that they will replace the charging unit and that will fix the issue. After the repair this issue started coming back again after 1-2 days. I called the service center and they said please come and deposit it to them and they will repair it without any extra charge. I went to the service center and submitted the device in working condition as I was able to call from the device. When I asked for a Job Sheet Number they said they are too busy with the work load and cannot provide me with any job sheet number. They said they will inspect and get back to me with the reason and cost for repair. Then in the night I got a message from the service center stating that my device is liquid damaged and will not be covered under warranty and I would have to pay Rs. 6000 for repairing it. When I had submitted the device the device was not at all liquid damaged as the device was turning on and I was able to make calls from the device. This is a story that the service center has made up for charging money from me falsely. Against this issue I have complaint in the Motorola India customer care(18001022344) with the Complaint Id : 151018000532 stating that they should help me against the service center guys and repair me device properly. But I did not get any help from the Motorola India service center also. I had filed a complaint on 16/10/2015 and was supposed to get a call from the Motorola team till 19/10/2015. But I did not get any call from them. I called them up on 20/10/2015, the guy from the call center said I will definitely get a call on 20/10/2015 end of day. And when today I called them saying that I did not received any call, they said that the call was already made on 19/10/2015 around 12:35PM. I have checked my call history and all but did not find it to be true. They are simply delaying this issue from their end. And I do not expect this type of behavior from such a big company.",

Another problem is the battery which drains completely if you do bit more browsing on 3G, Or you navigate using GPS/google maps. Not meant for heavy user. It feels heavy at 149 gms. Also the view is not very clear in daylight even if you increase the brightness. One strange thing happened once. Its power switch stopped working, It was awkward, I was not able to switch the screen off, or to take calls. I tried factory reset, and it was working again. Overall it is an average phone.",

            "comment": "If you are planning to buy this phone I would advice you to reconsider that decision... this is easily the worst phone one can opt to buy... before going to the negatives first i have to admit the positives like big screen and fantastic camera. I am not denying it but the stress created by the negatives far outweigh the positives. the first thing is that this phone has a huge lag. Apps take so much time to open. even a simple contact app takes atleast 30 seconds to open. I dont have to tell you about other apps. It will irritate you to the core. The second negative is the time it takes to charge this phone with the charger they have given. It takes forever(5 hrs) to charge the phone to complete 100%. I have started using power banks or connect it to the laptop to charge it. SO please dont buy this phone. The specs might look great but the truth is that it will suck the life out of you. you will become a monster waiting for the phone to respond. P.S : I have verified the problems i have mentioned above with 5 other friends who use the same phone. SO buy the phone at your risk.",

            "comment": "I used Moto G (1st generation) for more than a year. The touch, feel and performance of the product is really good and bet a value for many. With the same expectation I ordered 2nd generation. I used it for more than 2 months and it failed to please me as much as Moto G 1st generation. Main problems I face are issues with touch and Pathetic battery life. Battery wouldn't last a complete day. Touch wont respond to the notifications we receive while using a mobile, I had to lock and unlock the phone to open the notifications. Some times the touch wouldn't respond for the calls to receive. Another issue is with the YouTube Application. We have an option in YouTube to caste your screen with your YouTube enabled Smart TV. Every time I cast my screen with my TV, Videos playback doesn't simply work and it shows the static picture on screen instead of video. All in all the phone is not worthy as its predecessor or its successor 3rd generation.",

I contacted the Motorola service center and call center team. They just gave some trouble shooting tips which is not worth. So i just asked flipkart for a solution and waiting for their reply.",

Motorola is pioneer in this and brought many revolution in communication devices. If we talk about specifications this is phone where u'll get what ever is required for a moderate user (don't buy if your are a hard core programmer and you have to program in your cellphone). Like it, go for it",

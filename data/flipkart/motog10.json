So my answer you'll get these all in one, your answer is MOTO G2 , You are getting Snapdragon processors (Quad Core), with great GPU, 1 GB RAM, 16 GB Internal memory. my first hand experience, as i opened the box and switch on the phone, i was asked to update my phone in Android 5.0.2, so first experience to me was awesome, it has great screen with great color production, gorilla glass 3 so no scratches, then great stereo speakers, awesome quality! Games running smoothly! even Asphalt and NOVA 3, memory is 16 gb so no issues in storage also, you can install upto 64 GB card as well. Call quality is better than any other phone, its really loud. So overall I can say I am totally satisfied with the Product Motorola has made, and finally thanks to flipkart as well to providing this great service!",

While flipkart has provided me with a replacement instantly and I should get the replacement tomorrow, i am having serious doubts over motorola's product quality. Understand that this is not a very expensive phone, but having two failures within a month of the original purchase makes me wonder. Buyer beware",

We cant see who is calling.. we have press the power button put password then only we can attend the call. 2.The GPS is worst. It will show \"my location\" in some where else. Now \"get directions\" will be always \"wrong direction\".. one notification remains in display for more than 10 seconds even i tried to swipe off it is not working. Apps stuck like anything.... Sometimes answer option will not work.. The screen stuck when I swipe the apps pages. ZERO STAR......",

            "comment": "I am writing this review after 15 days of use. I purchased from FlipKart and as usual the delivery was great. Moto G has all the features one can think off at this prize range. 1 GB RAM works fine along with a pretty good processor speed. Android Lollipop update did not find any lag as mentioned by few of the reviewers. Battery could have been better. It comes only for a day and surprisingly charging is too slow with the charger available with the phone. You may need to get a power bank for quick charge. It has a great look but slightly bulkier with the MOTO cover (pretty expensive only the light magnetic sensor is the advantage) you can do away with the cover. Just the next day of my purchase the cover prize was reduced from 1700 to 1179 for royal blue. Screen is real with a scratch resistant LCD glass. I did not find any difference with AMOLED and this staff after using it. Sunlight readability is very good. Two sim slots are nicely planned along with the dual speakers at the front. But be careful about the dust accumulation inside the speakers. Repeatedly you have to swipe it off. All the inbuilt applications and playstore makes it easier to download the application. Vocie clarity and other stuffs are good. Signal response is very good here even being a dual SIM Mobile. This has been the basic problem with most of the dual SIM mobiles. So ensure two SIMS are used actively in these mobiles. I had a serious problem with signal reponse in my earlier purchased Nokia 730 which I had returned to flipkart after 20 days of use. Flipkart kindly aceepted the fact and obliged the return. Money was refunded to my wallet. Then I came to know that Nokia 730 has serious problem of call drop due to poor signal response. This is happening for Nokia 535 also which my collegues have purchased. I am not comparing here the Nokia 730 with Moto G2, but there is some problem in the former. However battery of 730 way better than Moto G2. To conclude there are more porns and less cons in Moto G which is the best bet to go in the present changing scenario of the mobile and keeping the overall budget in mind. If the budget is within 15000 its a best bet. My rating would be 4 out of 5. It looses one star because of the battery.",

Tremendous display, terrific sound quality, overwhelming response of the touch caliberation, splendid camera quality and resolution, superb front camera. Internal memory of 16 GB gives a righteous usage of the phone in all spheres. Battery back up is one of the issues that one can find in many of the Multimedia Smart phones now a days. Overall experience is just AMAZING !! Really Value for money. The best smart phone in the price range of 13k.",

Its has the same awesome battery. The camera which was lagging in the 1st Gen has been taken care of .I wont say its perfect but yes its better. The Lollypop has been updated in all of the Moto G's which is before any other brand except Google itself. I don't have any cons for this particular product. Motorola had nailed it and everyone knows it.",

Now coming to the specifications:- Camera/video recording - Excellent,recording is @720p . Speakers - moderate sound. Battery - Good but if U surf or play games too much battery consumption is very high.. Apart from all the functionality i got the Lollipop update at the end of January.. Totally worth it..I suggest others to buy this... :)",

            "comment": "every thing is good about this phone except for battery life. If your are a heavy gamer. you gonna charge it 3 times a day. but on normal usage it lasts for about 20 hrs. Its video recording seems to have a problem. It bumps suddenly from bright to dard video recording and this continues if lighting conditions vary very rapidly. like if you move your camera very much then it will surely happen. Good thing is the moment you are connected to internet, it receives android lollipop OTA update. Try to switch off adaptive brightness and manually increase the brightness a bit so that its visibly clearer. try to buy a good IN EAR earphones because the earphone that comes with it is old fashioned. Also buy OTG and USB cable because its not provided here. After upgrading to lollipop if you see exclamation mark (!) inside a triangle in the notification panel saying \"restricted access\" then remember that you will still be using your sim perfectly, but this usually happens if you cut out normal sim into micro sim instead of purchasing a brand new micro sim. Also it happens if you use nano sim with adapter. So try to buy a new micro sim and donot cut old sim/ normal sim to micro sim Also remember that both the sim when inserted will click and then lock into position. Donot just insert sim and leave it without hearing a click sound. And USB OTG is fully supported. IF its a video or image or music then just go to gallery and you will find it. For all other file types just install \"FILE COMMANDER\" from google play store. Donot increase sound to full volume on front speakers as it will produce a chattering noise at that high level. HTC phones front stereo speakers are way ahead and advanced in this catagory so donot compare it with that. but overall build quality is smooth and sems branded. its value for money. and you can play all high end games like modern combat 5, asphalt 8, real racing 3 etc. But remember that its buffer memory is pretty low so donot expect to resume game if you are multi tasking. Once you are out of game in pause mode then when you return you will see the game has restarted. Good thing is that it doesnot get heated up no matter what game you play/ how much time you play. Just try not to play game during charging. As this will increase your overall battery life. And remember that battery is fixed as phone is water proof. if any thing happens to you battery then just go to motorola service center and they will change it for you. Donot open your phone and remove any of internal components or even battery as there is a nano coating. If you expose any of terminal then your phone will not be water proof. And believe me Its totally water proof. I have dropped my phone in a bucket full of water, it drowned but still it is working like a charm. i suggest it to every one. one last thing, if you see exclamation mark (!) beside wifi or network symbol on top after upgrading to lollipop then dont be afraid its just because of signal strength. you can still be able to use it normally",

Since its shares the same configuration as the same old Moto-G 1st Gen phone, except for the bigger display, battery backup goes for a toss here. Every night I have to charge it for sure.

Gave it to authorized service center in Kochi, ADR Technologies. They took 1.5 months to repair it. But after 1 hour of usage it started showing the same issue. Again I gave it to the service center. Till now I have visited the service center 12 times (it is 45 Kms away from my home). But still they could not repair it. Service center people said, they have done everything possible. When I asked for the replacement they said they are not getting approval from Motorola and asked me to contact Manikandan, regional manager of Motorola. For the last 3 months, I have been calling so called regional manager, Manikandan for the replacement. All these days he was telling me stories like no stock, not getting approval etc. (At least he used to pick my calls, but did nothing). Now he stopped picking my calls. It looks like I have to go to consumer court to get it replaced. This is my experience with Motorola. SO BUY AT YOUR RISK !!! I have bought 3 Motorola handsets through Flipkart, Moto E, Moto G 2 & Moto X. I have put the same rating and review for all these as I am reviewing after sales service of Motorola not the product.",

Service center says you shouldnt keep the phone in Jeans and all. Not covered in warranty due to external damage. Pretty lame reason for a reputed company.

Only issues with this phone is like Samsung phones it doesn't have hardware navigation keys at the bottom (only software keys)... which becomes an issue with the overall size of the display, as the phone uses a lot of space in the bottom for the software keys (specially in a web browser app) you screen scrolling size goes small. You can install Autohide softkeys app for this... Overall phone battery comes for almost a day and half of regular using (mine was rooted though with lots of apps and running widgets) so for the normal user it should last 2 days... Flash is like samsung (bright led) No good fixed battery (should sell the phone in a year after warranty) else battery cost will be high for replacement as it is fixed...",

Android is now tied very closely to Google and there is no escaping google on this phone. No way to \"not\" link your phone to google, and share all your information. The recent Lollypop update has made the slower, and the UI is not very good. There are several limitations in using this new design, for example the phone application, and finding contacts requires several more taps. I preferred the KitKat UI. I would recommend the users to wait for a little for updating their phones while until Lollypop achieves more maturity. Please note: There is no easy way to revert back to Kitkat once updated.",

Now it wont even last properly for like 16 hrs from full charge. no changes at all as far as new apps installed or something, but the battery drain diff is substantiallly more !!!! Please note, am not saying the phone is faulty or something....just as a heads up for ppl who might not have upgraded to lollipop to take this into consideration !! And, have read up online that lollipop does have these issues irrespective of the phones...so, it explains a lot !! All in all, the phone is a value for money with nice features in my opinion !!

The new lollipop update gave a great new look an enhanced the performance of multi tasking. But the Games and Videos run smoother on Kitkat ie. Android 4.4.4. Thats why waiting for 5.1 update. In all u should buy this because at this amazing price till now any smart phone gave these many features.",

Well I noticed it after I updated my phone to the latest version of android (lollipop 5.0.2). Soon after the upgrade the screen brightness of my handset (black) visibly reduced. This was not the case for the white handsets although the hardware configuration for both the device is the same. There are many colleague of mine who are using moto g2 and most of them have white devices. When I compared my screen display quality to theirs it was quite dull. But when I compared it to a black handset it was the same. Sounds weird but true. I have asked for a replacement (a black set again), so let\u2019s see if it has the same issue.",

But after about 2 weeks of use, i was fed up with the speed, and asked flipkart for the replacement. And I am so happy, that without asking any silly questions, flipkart sent me a replacement immediately :D, and guess what, the device i got works fine, and even after upgrade to android lolipop its fast :) So maybe a defect in the old device. It was a pleasure to shop on flipkart. My next purchase is the Moto 360 :D",

I called up customer care within 2 hours of receiving the product and asked for a replacement. I was surprised to hear that the delivery status has not yet been updated in their system and hence I need to wait. The wait never ended even after 4 days, 6-7 phone calls and 6-7 emails to the customer care. Even as I write this review I have not got my replacement phone !! How can Flipkart sell such poor quality products? And how can they take customers for granted after collecting the money, not even taking the request for replacement for 4 days after customer informing them about the defect !! I will think 100 times before deciding to purchase an electronic device from Flipkart in future.",

With the support of Google you get the latest updates faster than any one. The 1 GB RAM is sufficient for multi-tasking and there can be a lag of 0.1 sec but you need not worry about that. Sound quality is amazing and provides you true surround sound. Simple, smooth and efficient. I think you should go for it. Moto has been revolutionized! Peeps it's a good device with excellent features!",

The filpkart delivery was amazing got it in a day without opting the in a delivery option that too with a Rs.1200 flip cover absolutely free with it! Now coming on the phone's performance, its amazingly built with strong exterior design which is very stylish. The resolution and display is very vivid n sharp and strong hardware. Despite of its 1GB RAM its performance never lags as it does in most of the samsung handsets. Must say i was facing a few issues in my device's performance in some sectors because of the latest Android Lollypop update which on calling Moto India helpline was immediately resolved. Personally i liked the kitkat version because of the transparent black background in menu which turns white in lollypop update & its not changeble. The most important issue or should i say the major con of this device is its battery. The former 1st gen moto g had the same 2070 mah battery which the phonemaker should have increased but infortunately it did'nt. So the battery lasts for a closely fair 1 day upon your usage. But the worst part is its 3.5 hrs charging time which is damn disturbing. If someone does'nt have the patience of charging it for so long then he\\she should have to buy a reliable power bank with it. Otherwise if you are bored with your first time samsung's poor performance in this same price range then i would suggest you just go for it, it won't disappoint you like samsung did.",

I always preferred 10-12k range phones for medium use like email, couple of apps, camera but no games. I was really a proud user, liking so much. The display, camera performance was very impressive. I did not have any issue fist two months. Even recommended so many friends. But slowly it started showing its actual characteristics. I started getting issues one by one. Making call: now it takes more time connecting any number. sometime have to make several tries. Contacts: It takes much time to open. Hung: if couple of apps are opened in background, it will hung. You can not do anything without restarting. Surprisingly, showing similar kind issues on other two mobiles at my office. ok, Updated to Lollipop hoping the issues may go, but frustrated, problems increased. So my love ka the end with Motorola. I am still using this since no option, I can not afford or buy another phone within 5months again. Also, wanted to inform the users who does not look at the SAR value, before buying. It has highest SAR value than any other reputed brand, just like the Chinese phones. Very SAD. Thanks/ Ibnul",

The biggest con is that the battery cannot be removed, it is inbuilt. Very disappointing. :( If the phone gets stuck, when all fails, the last resort is to unplug the battery and the device will restart, that is not possible with this device. Another big disappointing factor is - the phone has just 1 GB RAM. For a big phone,, 1GB is too less, and hence it lags. One thing I like about the phone is the Camera - camera is quite good. The lollypop update tried to compensate for the dislike I had, but can't seem to overcome the obvious latency. Overall, I will never buy nor will recommend anyone to buy it. On the contrary,, Moto E is far better.",

I have been given your contact information regarding the replacement of MotoG2 handset which I bought from Flipkart somewhere around September ( on 24-09-2014, see invoice attached) . Within 3 months, the phone stopped working and the service center guy told me that motherboard was damaged. After 3 weeks, when my phone started working, the camera stopped working and now again I have to contact the service center and God knows how much time it will take to repair. I tried factory reset, camera updates, and even installed other/Google camera software but even then it is not working. It seems to me that the hardware of my handset have some serious issues and even if I got my camera fixed, there is no guarantee that some other problem won't be coming in near future. So, its better if you can replace the set and provide me a new one since this is totally a hardware problem and I want a replacement of my phone. Hope to get a prompt response from you. Customer care shared two numbers with me Regional head details: Ashish Patil - ashish.patil@ensureservices.in Contact - 9324395043 Parvez Jawed - parvez.jawed@b2x.com Contact - 8826579279 Ashish's no is always busy and Parvez's no does not exist.

Ans: 85%..... So over a night a phone consume 15% of battery even if no one use it...... PATHETIC!!!!",

Thus it has resulted me to write below email and inform my other friends about the actual work done by them. I ordered a new Motog2 mobile phone from Flipkart. After 3 to 4 days it got dispatched at my home place \u2013 Within 3 months of purchase \u2013 One fine day my phone completely stopped working. So, I visited to nearby service center \u2013 I was really shocked to know that the problem in my phone was related with the Motherboard. When I checked Invoice, I found that Invoice copy was Incorrect. This was not at all expected from the FlipKart services. So, I called them and reported about the issue. Due to incorrect invoice I could not submit the phone at service centre. I had to called flipkart multiple times but response was same every time \u2013 \u201c Will soon change your Invoice\u201d. Also they want snapshot of my mobile phone, so that they can update the invoice, that\u2019s mean they do not have proper information regarding which mobile was sent to me. While followup, according to one of executive no need to provide snapshot and ignore that mail, but second executive says(after 2-3 days) need to send snapshot or either tell us the correct IMEI number. It was really a pain for me to do a follow-up on such bullshit scenario. How this would be possible \u2013 Within 3 months of purchase, Motherboard got dead. So, here I believe that they\u2019re just making customers fool. I reported same issue to FlipKart but till today there is no proper response. I\u2019m really helpless here \u2013 No one turned till today. I\u2019ll soon update this all in social sites. Also, will recommend my other friends \u2013 Not to purchased any of the electronic devices from Flipkart. It is really bad, You guys are cheating us.",

The batter is not running even for full 12 hours, with not so extensive usage. Most of the time my phone is deposited at reception and not used. Another thing is this misleading airtel offer. They have 3G network in very limited circles and for that you have to have some balance in your prepaid account. They flood you with automated messages where if you dont read and just tap OK, your balance drains faster than the water from your washbasin. Buy the phone only if you are genuinely impressed by it. Don't fall in trap of these misleading offers.",

I reached to service center and after examining the phone, they told me that slot is damaged, How could a slot be damaged when actually I never used it. They deposited my phone and told me that it will take 10 days to get repair. It has been 14 days and till now phone is not repaired. When ever I speak to the service center executive, they extend the date by another 10 Days. Called the customer support center and they provide and SR and assured than with 24 hours I'll be getting call back regarding update status. It has been 4 days and I have not received any call regarding my phone. This is very frustrating. So if you are planning to buy this phone, please do kept in mind that their is no after sale support from motorola. Moto is least concern about it's customer.

Though the status of tracking was shown as \"Out for delivery\" from 12.10 pm itself, I did not receive the product till the end of the day. When I contacted the customer care @ 7.30 pm for this, they just told me to wait and assured that it will be delivered by 9 pm. But it did not happen. Again when I contacted, they told me that it will be delivered by 8th, though it happens to be a Sunday. Again, @ 11.14 am the status was updated as \"Out for delivery\". I did not receive any single call form the Ekart the whole day. But @ 1.12 pm, it has been updated in their system as \"Undelivered As Customer Requested For Reschedule\". Without even trying to call the customer, they have updated this status. When I contacted Flipkart stating this issue, they were not even ready to check with Ekart about this. They only told me to wait till 10th Feb. Flipkart simply wants to hold the customers and make them wait by giving false promises. I have received the product now, but they have not yet responded to complaint that I have raised. I am totally dissatisfied and disappointed with Flipkart's service. Hopeless! They just think they have captured the market and the customers will not leave them even if they provide the worst service. They have mistaken. Just know it Flipkart! You are not the only one in this market. You will be extinct very soon if you continue your service at this level.",

The camera is good but not much of improvement really. It has two front facing speakers yet the fire at lower volume than the single rear speaker on the 1st Gen. The battery backup is very slightly lesser than the 1st although it is hardly noticeable. Now coming to performance. This phone performed good on Kitkat, although no comparison with the 1st Gen. It lagged a bit while switching between applications. Despite the same hardware, the 1st easily outperforms it and games run much smoother and load faster. After the Lollipop update, the difference in performance has widened even more. 1st Gen performs very well on Lollipop. Resource management is better than even that on Nexus 5. But on the 2nd Gen it has created a number of problems like unnecessary lags even when you switch the WiFi on. Games take even longer to load. Not at all satisfactory. Overall I would say that in this budget, Asus Zenfone 5 is the better than this phone both in terms of performance and camera. If you want to go with Samsung, the Neo 3 is also a good option. Moto G 2nd Gen is disappointing and drops the standard the 1st had raised.",

The phone doesnt seem to last me for more than 8-10 hours after a full charge, and tht too with jst normal usage. No heavy games, no excessive downloads n surfing, jst usual chats n phone calls n still m shocked to see my battery entering the red zone by the 8th hour. I am really disappointed coz i havnt had such issues with my previous phone which was lumia 520. Only fr the battery drain i rgret buying this phone.

The unit was dispatched by WS retail on time,but today morning when I checked the status of the item..I was shocked to see Cancelled! I called the customer care...they told me I cancelled the item. I tried to convince them that I did not but they didn't listen to me..so I requested to talk to their TL then Mr. Tarun Kumar came online and when I asked him why was my shipment cancelled..then I was shocked again to the reply he gave me..he said it was cancelled by the courier company as you did not receive their call. I told him why wud the courier company call me when the product has not even reached my city and no one actually called...then he flipped his answer and said no sir you cancelled it.This is the customer service of India biggest e-commerce website! Now I was told to order the product again...now when I am trying to order the product..I am shocked again to notice...it says not available with any seller at my pincode! Then how come flipkart delivered the same product 2 weeks back? Flipkart is losing it and has already lost my trust. My brother won't get the gift which I promised him.",

With some negatives like you cannot use wi-fi direct without an external app, little heavy in weight, headphones are not the kind you expect to come with good smartphones and charger does not have a detachable usb cord. But still when you compare all these things with the speed of the phone, battery back-up, overall user interface and amazing features, you forget about the cons of the product. Unlike other smartphones, it never hangs and even when multi-tasking, it responds very very fast. Overall, I'm simply in love with the phone. As far as Flipkart is concerned, it's the best online shopping website. Very quick and prompt delivery. I ordered this phone and got the delivery the day after. The products are always packed very nicely. I trust WS Retail and never got any wrong or damaged product ordered from this seller. Thanks to Flipkart Team for making online shopping so easy and trust worthy. :)",

However I doubt whether there is some defect in the 2nd gen Moto g devices. 1. One of my friend who bought Moto G 2nd gen, had to return the device after 3-4 months as it was not booting. Service center says motherboard problem. Luckily it was during the warranty period. 2. Few weeks later, ie today, the phone I bought is not charging. Motherboard problem - says service centre. When I enquired, found that many users are facing the same motherboard related complaints recently. So I suggest make your choices wisely.",

A lot better than the samsung junk that is being sold at exorbitant prices and fails to give consumers anything. I've used the device extensively, back when it was Ice cream sandwich, kitkat and now Lollipop. Its come a long way. Its still my favorite mobile. Only glitch is that using in at bangalore with any network, The network here is soo bad, that the battery drains by 10 in the morning. Using it elsewhere or in a single sim, it just lasts and lasts. One word of advice, if you are using the dual sim functionality, make sure that they are on the same operators. This helps save your battery. With more than one user mode on the device, am now able to configure multiple users, one for home and one for work. And keep both separate. If you are looking for a budget motorola mobile, close eyes, get this :)",

Today the Flipkart Team approved my request after speaking to me, they asked me to go the service center which didn't want to hence they told me that they will pick up the defective piece by 11th Feb'14 and refund my amount by 8 days but everything was done by today itself. Pickup was done by 7pm refund was done by 9.30pm to my wallet, then I called and asked to credit it to my account which was done immediately. Excellent and Incredible customer service.

The packaging and all the other stuff like specs have been spoken about already, so I'll just skip on that. Now, It's been a week since I got the phone up and running for me. From what I've gathered by looking at reviews for this phone before buying it, I must say that I am indeed lucky to get a good piece. As soon as I booted it up and signed in, it showed that the Lollipop update was waiting for me. I quickly upgraded my phone and started using it. So here's my experience with the phone: -> The interface super smooth and feels awesome to use. -> The battery is awesome even though my phone has WiFi enabled for about 15 hours a day, and also only when I start playing heavy games, the battery starts to drain a bit faster than usual. ->The earphones are okay. I'm not against the Moto earphones, but I'd have liked it with the buds. ->The camera quality is better than what I thought it would be. -> Also some people faced problems wit the lock button and the volume rockers, but i found them compact and firm. On the whole, holding the phone feels good, and using it feels way too good! :D",

            "comment": "I wanted to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3 and Iphone with this dual SIM phone. My Samsung GS3 served me well for 2 years but off late had become very laggy and the battery life had become quite bad. I purchased a new 2250 Mah battery from RAW but that did not help much. It seems the phone needed more battery after all the upgrades. I was initially a 32 GB memory card on the phone and recently installed a 64 GB memory card. My iphone was a 16 GB model and was running out of memory. The Motorola Second Generation is a well designed easy to hold phone. The first time you start up the phone, the screen looks washed out on google play compared to the Samsung Galaxy S3 but this is not a screen problem. Samsung phones seem to have over-saturated vivid displays which will make most phones look pale. The screen on the Moto G is good and something you will quickly get used to. The pure android OS is also nice. It operates smoothly but is not fast. The points that I do not like about the phone are 1. Though I purchased the phone for the pure android experience, the pure android experience leaves you feeling short changed. The enhancements made by mobile manufactures, though not the best for performance, are really good for usage and I soon started missing these. 2. AC3 audio is not support on several video files. The same video files worked without issues on the Galaxy. H/W decoding also did not work on several videos. The H/W decode option works for all files on the S3 3. The camera firmware or camera is very poor, text can never be captured correctly. I used both the Iphone and Samsung for OCR from clicked photos. This cannot be done with the Moto G second gen since the text cannot be cleanly captured 4. File transfer rates from the file to a memory card are slower than the Galaxy. I regularly download files and move them to the memory card. While I get 9 MB/s on the 32 GB card in the Galaxy the same card gives me 6 MB/s on the Moto G. 5. For some reason the screen never feels bigger. On all text applications, the amount of text that fits on Galaxy and Moto G is the same. I believe this is because the phones are very close in screen size and the scaling probably happens at a slightly larger screen size. However the phone also has the following good points. 1. Good battery life, can last through the day 2. Non laggy performance 3. Good WIFI connection 4. Decently fast browser experience. 5. Quick syncing of photos and folders (even if you don't want them synced!!!) I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 almost 3 years ago for 22,400. The moto G second generation, priced at 12,999, doesn't make the S3 look long in the tooth after such a long time, which speaks a lot about the hardware on both phones. The Moto G has average hardware but a great implementation. Except for the AC3 audio everything works fine. The pure android does not give it the polish of a S3 but everything works well when needed. If you want a great phone for productivity, reminders, OCR, fantastic photos and videos, any iphone will be a seriously good phone. I am not replacing both my phones. If the Samsung Galaxy S3 had a dual SIM option and a better battery life, I would have made that my primary phone. For now I continue to use the iphone and the new Moto G, which is disappointing. For the price of a Moto G second gen there are lots of good phones available and they have much better camera interfaces, but If you want a slick well built lag free phone that wont go slow on you after many upgrades, I believe the Moto G second gen is good choice.",

Moto G 2014 was priced Rs12999/- This is my personal opinion but I feel that 1.2GHZ seems a little underpowered for a 5inch display. I dont understand why reduce the price. Keep the same price and offer little something more. Like a bigger battery or a better chipset. There is no lag in everyday use but sometime when there are a 10 or so windows open in the background, you do notice slight lag in Kitkat. Lollipop have made the phone more refined. In normal use, you dont find the battery inadequate but use it a little heavily and the battery drain is quite noticeable. One needs to use teh phone keeping in mind that days itinerary! I am happy with the device with a few complaints which really shouldn't matter for the price",

The only con found is its \"batter life\" which Motorola needs to work upon a bit. Else & otherwise..its an All-rounder phone! My rating here proves the worth of price & had gifted it to my Beloved on our Anniversary! Going for the other Chinese brand & cheaper brands wouldn't help you much rather go for a Brand, which keeps it value & words! Also, Flipkart have done a good Job for Customers with tie-up of SBI Cards & an additional discount of 10%, adds one more advantage to buy this phone! Cheers to Motorola & Flipkart as well!!!

The battery drains too much, hardly 6-8 hours of backup with a 3G connection and takes a lot of time to charge (mostly overnight charging). The gorilla glass is not up to expectations as scratches come to is very easily. Speakers gives a cracking noise at high volumes which is very annoying and unacceptable. And to top it off during the update from kitkat to lollipop the phone just crashed, and i am unable to start it since then. The mobile keeps restarting and nothing is happening, I feel terrible now to have brought this phone as it feels like a waste of money. Don't know what to do, would recommend all of you to think again before buying this product.",

Its been over 2 weeks since I gave my phone for repair and I haven't got it back yet. The service is terribly slow and disappointing. The worst part is that I lost all 8 gb of data id stored on my phone so thank god for auto back up that i could recover some of it. Apart from the fact that my phone crashed, its also most inconvenient to use and needs an app for almost everything including one to set a song as ur ringtone and a file explorer among others. The camera lacks basic options like timer and resolution settings. The drop down menu is very tiresome for example it requires u to go to settings then display then auto rotate instead of the usual single click. Also it dosnt come with a connector cable is if u dont have one from an old phone then thats going to be a problem. Its little things like these that make it very frustrating to use this phone. The best phone for this price is ASUS ZENFONE 5. Its a brilliant phone, amazing processing, useful inbuilt apps, a drop down list u can edit based on ur convenience and an overall a much more satisfactory phone. I've used both phones and buying moto g 2 to replace my Zenfone 5 (when it got stolen :/) was a bad decision on my part and I urge u to not make the same mistake. Im sure you've seen a lot of statistics, but from a user point of use Asus Zenfone 5 is the best choice at this price range and Moto g 2 is a huge disappointment.",

            "comment": "I've used many phones but truly this phone stands at a higher position than the rest. And moreover it will be upgraded to Google's sweetest Lollipop (5.0.2) Pros- 1. A classy, cool, professional look. 2. Comes with Android Kitkat (4.4.4) But recently have been upgraded to Lollipop (5.0.2) 3. It was fast before, but amazingly fast after the lollipop update. 4. Good storage space (16 GB internal) with expandable storage. 5. It is rain water proof. (Its not a problem if its in your pocket when its raining. But that doesn't mean you should try it out with a bucket full of water. Come on!!! Its not Xperia Z series) 6. I've more than 85 apps installed in my phone (facebook, skype, Chrome, hangout, Line, temple run (1 and 2), subway surfer, compass, Picsart, camscanner, Flipkart, Instagram, Paytm, HDFC, redbus, Truecaller, messenger, whats app, and many more) Even after that it runs amazing fast with only 1 GB RAM. 7. No need to switch it off for changing sims or memory card. 8. Camera quality is awesome in bright light. and in low light it's good. 9. Touch is awesome, though I've matte screen guard, but the smoothness is amazing. 10. Sound is good, as they have made the speakers in front. 11. Can be charged with any USB chargers, unlike Xaomi Redmi, which can't be charged with any charger. Cons- 1. The charger sometimes get hot (in some particular charging points, not at all charging points) Though the phone doesn't get hot. 2. The LED notification light color is white. It can't be changed to any other color. 3. You can't remove the battery.",

I liked moto G 2nd gen very much then any other Brands beacuse of its display quality. I orderd on 29th Jan'15 & got my product delivered on 4th Feb 15. It's awesome but the problem was in the font camera & key section. The front facing cameras picture quality is ok but when i press the capture button its not taking the photo immediately it captures the photo after 5-6 seconds.The second problem is very bad response from the volume rocker buttons. So, i requested for replacement on 5th Feb 15 accepted by flipkart. Lets see how fast flipkart sovles their customers problem.",

Now coming back to Moto G 2nd Gen. After a setback from International market Motorola managed to launch a phone which grabbed a mass market all over the world with Moto E, G & now with Moto G2 & X2. This phone comes in Mid-Priced mobiles. Its looks are very good & its back cover gives a nice grip too. Just few days ago Moto rolled out Lollipop update for all mobiles and it good and faster than Kitkat at least I feel the same. It comes with raw OS so you will miss out some important apps like flash light etc. which you can download from Play Store. I will not go in technical details; but its display, color recreation & video output is really good. Also display comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3.0. With 2 front speakers it not a loud phone but speaker volume is good. & in box head phones are waste.. do not use you will feel pain after some time... Specially camera of Moto G is awesome & it can capture good details in day light but you will observe a little noise in night shots. Its flash is power full. This phone can handle lot of games like Fifa 14, Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8... Minor heating is observed after some game play. All in all its a great phone to buy under 15K... Cheers to Moto :-)",

I was looking for a phone wherein i was not ready to spend too much money on the phone since the prices keep fluctuating in the market day by day and at the same time was looking for a exchange of my Samasung Galaxy Y. Flipkart was kind offering this product with an exchange along with 10% discount on HDFC card which is a cracker. Now over to the phone: This is a 5 inch display phone with Gorilla protective glass which is scratch proof resistant. It comes with KitKat OS and i have already upgraded to Lollipop. The battery backup is not very useful as claimed by the manufacturer unless not continuous browsing, watching videos or playing games. If none of these are used, the battery can be easily managed for 1.5 days. Its a RAW android and display looks just fine. The camera is crisp and clear though it does not have Image Stabilization, so expect pictures to be blurred or grains under low light. It does not hang, and sometimes it heats up which is quite normal in any phones for that matter. The battery is not detachable and will need to be taken to the service center for replacement. The packing of this material was awesome, thanks to Flipkart.",

It may not respond to blinks and blows but using regular features of a smart phone like calling, messaging, browsing, etc. is visually unappealing but super fast. For those who understand motorcycles, it's like riding a two stroke. Light, fast and fun to use. Overall the phone feels premium and worth a lot more than what it costs. So here are the ratings comprising Average, Good and Very Good. There's nothing explicitly bad about this phone. Hope this helps: Build Quality: Very Good Features: Good Speed: Very Good Camera: Average Sound: Average Display: Average Battery: Average Value for Money: Very Good",

Flipkart got the phone to me one day in-advance than the promised date which is like a happy thing for me. The phone looks awesome, looks big and slim shaped, beauty of the Front cam is an asset to the phone. Rear Cam is obviously great not to forget. As soon as I loaded it up, it alarmed me that Lollipop is ready for upgrade. So I used to kitkat version for sometime to explore it was good and immediately upgraded to Lollipop. It was simply awesome. Loved the new look. Coming to the phone, touch is super cool, performance is too good. battery is what I will have to really check as today is the first day. So, I would say this looks like a mini NEXUS 5 for me atleast :) Thanks flipkart for being an awesome ambassador for a great phone in India.",

I actually had to think a lot as there were too many options available for me and I had to choose the best. Meanwhile the Yureka from Micromax's Yu brand played a swirling role in my decision making. There were many, Samsung S3 neo offered by Flipkart for 12500, Redmis's, the Micromaxes, the HTC's, the Nokia's...etc etc...woosh..I had a real wobble and spin into my head..!!! I ordered one, cancelled the next day...!!! Took me nearly a month to zero it to 2 phones...!! It was Yureka or Moto G2 to be chosen..!! Quality or Quantity..? Price or After sales service...? looks or build quality..? Ram or life...? It all converged into a single point...Why wasting money into a crap which has greater specs but will have no guarantee to last longer..? I made up my mind to select this one and was not at all disappointed...!!! I initially received a product one of whose speaker wasn't working...!! i replaced it with a brand new one and runs awesome...!!! Guess what..? I received the Android 5.0 lollipop update an the same day when I received it..!!! Battery life is average I would say...will drain out real quick if u are a photo maniac and keep clicking photos all day... :-) Best suited for the people planning for their first smart phone that should last longer and should be modern and little bit of gaming..!!! Awesome build quality and beautiful design..!!! Thumbs up for this phone for it came on my birthday and its my 9th day with my buddy...!!! I love him and im sure that u will too..!!! Close ur eyes and go for it...!!!",

So, for those who wants to buy a phone and stick with it a bit longer time, then my recommendation would be any phone which has good customer care service history. For eg:- Samsung , Nokia, Micromax(Indian company-must encourage it) cons 2 :- You would be luckiest alive creature to have a moto g/g2 phone with no network problem. It is really really irritating to see ur network playing hide n seek mostly when u will be needing it more. So, if u have a Girlfriend who calls u quite frequently, be prepared to breakup. Cons 3 :- Dual SIM feature is another myth - It all depends on your fon that wen u will be having single working slot, dual working slot or none of the slot working. Though, switching it off will serve the purpose. Well, there are lot more but once u r done with all f d above, I don't think I have to give u any more details. Conclusion :- Take ur time while purchasing one as it is going to stick with u quite for a good time... So, be choosy of ur selection. If some extra bucks will give u satisfaction, then its worth spending on. Good Luck! Happy Buying... (Y)",

Now coming to the review. The phone looks just brilliant and has smooth curved edges. It has got a non-removable battery, but that is not an issue for me. We hardly replace batteries for our smartphones, we just buy a new one!!! It ran on android kitkat but later I got the lollipop update and I am using that now. I have used the phone for a month now. No crashes and misbehaving UI for me as I have seen in certain forums about Moto G. The charger is just a beauty. It is sleek and white in colour and always does its job. It gets a bit hot while charging but it is not like it will melt and go out of order. I am using the phone without any clumsy screen guard (I have the motoshell for that :-)) and till now the screen is jet black and without any scratches. The HD display is mind boggling and it is such a joy to watch anything on the screen, whether it is playing videos or games or just reading books and stuff like that. I am in love with the digital vibrance of the display. Its too cool. Now coming to performance. Normally out of 1GB of ram 460 - 480 MB will always be free. While running some heavy weight games such as Asphalt 8 or Dead Trigger it will come down to some 320MB or so. So according to me it is quite efficient with its RAM usage. It is a joy to play games on it with it Adreno subsystem. There is not noticeable lag on the UI while entering or exiting heavy applications. Battery life (its a bit early to comment) could have been better but that is not a downside as per me. The stock headphones are not that good and does not produce good thump or bass. I would like Motorola to work on that in future iterations. There are no heating issues while playing games. I have played games for couple of hours straight, and the only heat I get is where I hold it, that is my own body heat transferred to the set. The stock android runs great and I dont like to disturb the ecosystem by installing rubbish apps. The apps bundled are enough for most of our needs except gaming which we need to download. Ofcourse there is no File manager software, which is a downside slightly to this awesome product but you can use freely available ES Explorer or Solid Explorer for this purpose, not a big deal. The speakers are awesome and generates stereo quality sound. I am not deterring you from buying Micromax Yu or Redmi mobiles, but there have there fair share of problems albeit the low price, but Motorola has got it perfect this time with Moto G. I would like them to add 4G LTE to future models though. Hope you find this review helpful. Thanks and do but it without second thoughts. You wont regret it :-) :-) :-)",

Otherwise phone is fantastic. Camera fast and great, Android lollipop is awesome; I like the phone very much. Good buy.",

The display is amazing, built quality is top class, feels sturdy, the interface is impeccable. Supplied accessories are rubbish but they should have made the charger detachable (it is fixed, means no USB cable supplied, you have to buy or use old spare ones). But for the price I don't think it leaves anything to complain for. Hat's off to Moto for bettering a remarkable 1st gen device into an object of awe!",

Not able to play ppsspp games. RAM shows only 851 MB. Pros: Touch is very smooth. never realized lag between switching apps and in multi tasking.. Supports OTG.

Now today Jan 14th i got my replacement mobile. But this phone once i opened and started using am getting wire burnt smell in usb port and in headphone port. While charging the smell is too much. Also once i opened back cover there are some sticker marks inside the phone which doesnt look like a new product. And browsed in net about this issue, came to know many moto g2 has these issues. Hence many people requesting for return, the replacement product given to customer is not a genuine new product, its another defective product returned by another customer. Flipkart & WS-Retail & Motorola is cheating people around here. Dont buy this phone. I lost hope on flipkart bad service. No proper quality check. Now i requested flipkart for good replacement or better return my money P.S : I am a regular flipkart buyer, got many mobiles through flipkart recently i got two moto products from flipkart which works fine till now..but this moto g purchase made me unsatisfied.",

Many tasks get stopped while in the background. At normal use the free RAM is about 180MB which is very very low as compared to zenfone 5 which has about 1.2GB free RAM at normal use. Also, in price factor, Zenfone 5 is much better. Camera, is also better in zenfone 5. The benchmark scores of nenamark 2, quadrant standard and others are a way much better for zenfone 5. Even zenfone 4 beats moto g IInd in benchmarks. Only in looks is moto g IInd beter than zenfone 5. Zenfone 5 looks a bit large in size.",

Cons: 1.there are some vertical lining on my display when screen is off ,only visible in sunlight ,but does not affect while using the device. 2.lags sometimes when multiples app open in background. and i would suggest that do not put matte screen guard on this device ,screen start to look like pixelated",

Everyone has written about the phone, so i dont think i need to mention all the pros and cons all over again. For those guys who are confused between this and Asus Zenfone 5: * Go for Moto G Gen 2, though the camera is not as great as asus, but the lifeline (battery) of the phone is great, and this can save your life in difficult situations! Experience with Flipkart Return / Service: * Sadly the phone i received was faulty ( The second sim card slot was not functioning properly and The Power button was faulty ) * I Called up on the flipkart Toll Free number and spoke to the CSR, she was really helpful and placed a Replacement request. * Within a day, i got my faulty phone replaced by a New Handset.",

Happy New Year Everyone I have been using this product for a month i ordered it on 1 december 2014 and recived it on 6 december 2014 thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone on time so first thing about the phone when you look at it is that it's build quality build quality is realy good it does not look cheap phone motorola has doen a great job with that if you are using the first gen of this phone then processing wise both are same had same chipset of 1.2Ghz qualcomm quad core processor 1 Gb ram so if you have the first gen motorola moto g don't buy 2nd gen 2.The phone has upgrades like the 5-inch HD screen but it is not full HD it is 720p HD resolution another thing it has a memory card slot which we don't have in first gen moto g and expandable up to 32GB 3.Camera performs it has 8mp rear camera and 2mp front camera rear camera is good in day light and also low light imaging is very well motorola has upgraded this camera and it is good but it takes some time to focus in artificial light front camera is good but when you take selfie's with it it produces shakey images both the camera can take video's in 720p HD and it also has a slow motion with 720p HD resolution 4.Gaming the device can handle high graphics game like asphalt 8 etc.But the phone gets heat up while playing games the stereo speakers perform very well and produce good sound 5.Display is 5 -inch HD display which has 720 X 1280 pixels resolution it is an IPS LCD screen with 5 inches in size 6.Battery is of 2070 mAh same as the first generation but is ok for this phone works all working day 7.It also supports OTG USB device very smoothly 8.Graphics are realy good adreno 305, 450MHz single core 9.Os is kitkat 4.4.4 with upgrade of 5.0 *Cons of this device are 1.First it should have atleast 1.5 GB ram 2.It should have more battery it is 15% less than the first gen moto g because of 5 inch screen 3.Front camera could have been improved 4.It some times needs more time to shift apps while multitasking 5.It's brousing speed decreases with 5-4 tabs running at a time 6.using camera for about 10 to 15 min decreases the battery percentage 7.As above mention the device heats up while gaming",

The battery drains really quickly. When I goto sleep at 12:30AM with the moto battery showing 33%, with all services like GPS, wifi and mobile data turned off, the battery goes down to 1% when I wake up at 6:30AM. 6hrs of idle time drained 32% of the battery. This battery issue is there in all moto g2 mobiles across the globe. Don't be fooled by its 2070 mAh battery, it is worthless! 2. User Experience - It hangs most of the time, and suddenly you see a pop-up of an app, which was never opened, to have stopped working! Apps like whatsapp and facebook take a long time to load and when it does, these apps hang up during the middle.",

But not that we can say very nice.... Internet over wi-fi and 3g working very nice. Screen is also very good.... Touch is very smooth and not get any scratch in general use. Speaker is very loud but not sounds well. Earplug and charger quality is not that well. Also there is no USB connector either in charger or additional. So, overall it is good phone.",

Even 2MP camera for selfie is kind of OK. 6) Expandable memory is good option. 7) Best feature from my opinion it will get all next Android updates. Pure stock android experience.

I got so sick and tired of manufacturers loading their bloatware and themed skins on top of the beautiful android interface. I also absolutely love on-screen navigation buttons. I would never go back to capacitive buttons or hard buttons again! This phone is guaranteed to get the Android Lollipop update in the coming weeks. What I love about the phone is its fluidity and battery life. However, since it is running stock android, I was disappointed because a lot of convenient CM11 features were missing. Things like not being able to customize the notification pull down menu, torch quick toggle etc. However these issues will be corrected once Lollipop is out as it borrows and improves upon a lot of features in CM11. Also, it would have been nice if it came with a multicolored notification LED :( The HD screen is sharp at normal viewing distance. I was honestly worried about whether I wouldn't like the downgrade from a 440ppi screen to a 300ppi screen. I'm happy to say that anything more than 300ppi is unnecessary as you won't be able to tell the difference 99% of the time and unless you hold a 440ppi screen right next to it. The only problem with the screen is that its not as nice as an AMOLED display. Although I appreciate the brightness of the LCD panel, i hate using it in bed due to the poor viewing angles. Tilt the phone too much and you start seeing the glow from the backlight emanating from the screen. It absolutely annoys me and it sometimes induces motion sickness. I hate how stupid the dual speakers look like. They could have been smaller... it makes the phone look like a plastic toy. The phone would have looked better if they just designed the speakers to look like grills instead of a bar. Anyways all in all its a fantastic phone. I don't have too many regrets except for the points stated above. But then again, I am paying only 13k for it and it is a bargain!",

Build and looks-The ergonomics are good and does not feel very thick due to its curved design. It looks more like a 30k phone than a 13k phone Display-The display is crisp and has natural colours. Text is clearly visible in bright sunlight. It does not need a scratch guard as it is protected y gorilla glass Cameras-Both the front and back cameras are amazing in outdoors as well as indoors Storage-We have 16gb internal storage out of whick about 12gb is available. In the generation of 128gb expandable storage, motorola is only providing 32gb expandable storage which is a minor con Battery life-It is good enough to last you a whole day of normal usage RAM-It is very less and can be clearly noticed while doing multitasking. I wouldnt mind payong 2k more for 1.5gb ram Sound-The front facing speakers provide a good audio effect but it is not very loud. Even call quality is very good UI and updates-It runs on the google now launcher which is very smooth. Even software updates are guaranteed for about 18 months. Still waiting for android L though Ignoring its cons considering the price of the phone it is awesome for the price. Even grand prime having qHD screen is priced higher",

You had to lock and unlock the phone for the problem to be solved but it would reoccur. So if that's the case in your phone too, apply for a replacement as the problem has been listed in the Motorola forums and everyone facing it has got a replacement. Here I'm listing only some of the cons of the device that I received after replacement: ->The lock key and volume button of the phone are not sturdy. They are loose and move sideways. ->The sensor of the phone I received seems to be defective. When during a call, I need to switch on a feature like speaker or open the dialing pad the phone screen goes off as soon as I try to touch it and comes on again when I move my finger away which is very annoying. I just hope that the problem doesn't become worse :( MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: I really doubt that Flipkart gives you a brand new product when you go for replacement. The phone I received after replacement showed signs of being used earlier although it was a completely packed piece. It must have been returned earlier by someone. So I would say that as far as possible try not to go for replacement as it is more probable that you may get an even worse product. Therefore, I would say that getting a perfectly working product without any defect in the first go is pure luck.",

Not giving 5 star because the only thing bad about going with Moto G is the Motorola customer care & service center. If by any chance you face any issue; definitely it is not going to be resolved or have to heavily pay for it. Otherwise phone is good; just pray you never need to contact the Motorola customer care & service center.",

The primary camera is pretty good in day but at night there are some grains in image. 2. The screen is awesome with Gorrila glass 3. 3. The grip, look and overall dimension is really better than other phones in this price range. 4. The battery backup is average with dual sim but the word in the air is about a great improvement in battery performance after the Lollipop upgrade. 5. The speaker sound is uniquely better among all the phones in this price range. 6. The battery backup during gaming is pretty good. 7. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE: STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE LOLLIPOP UPGRADE!!!!!!!!! :'(",

And we can play games like temple run,subway surface etc, without any lag.and I also watch HD (high defination) videos on it and the video clarity is also good. I found only one problem with this phone is that the front camera is good but it sometimes it lags but it is good for video call and normal photo it very high clarity photos. So I give it a rating of 4 star . And flipkart 's packing is also good and delivery is also very fast. I recommend you all to buy this phone from Flipkart.com thank you !",

And the thing to be notedis it is one of the lowest in the section too. Really a beauty to use. Pure android with good performance and is real fast. Working on this phone is flawless. The feature of expandable memory has made it almost perfect. But it too has some issues. The build quality is good but its glossy plastic back is still not a winner for all. It's camera which has 8 M is good but not great considering others in this price bracket. Also the screen resolution is not as good as the old moto g due to its larger screen size. But still it is not just good but great at this price. It's performance and the availability of pure Android is its biggest plus point. It's ability to handle high-def games is an added plus. If you have 15000 in your pocket look nowhere else.. Just go for it....",

            "comment": "Fundamentally I am Apple fan! Started with shuffle and now have an iPhone, 2 iPads etc. But wanted a second phone hence thought of Moto G 2nd Gen, off course after lot of research. I will split my feedback in three areas: 1. Flipkart Service - well excellent, you buy they deliver on time or before time. 2. Moto G phone: I am using this for a month now, excellent phone. But it took me time to get used to an \"non Apple\" phone. Initially was frustrated with sound quality, but realised that I have to hold it at a particular place and way and boom the sound was excellent. The battery was also a huge issue, draining at a speed higher than one can charge. Then I spent good amount of time on switching off all unnecessary things on the phone and the battery backup has been optimised to an extend that I have to charge once in two days. This is for full usage for its purpose i.e several con calls, email updates etc. I also used Jabber to login to meetings where the PPTwas being shared with the call, which means very heavy usage of net to display ppt and the call, worked very well as equivalent to my Apple, the display is slightly better. I deleted all unwanted preloaded applications and stopped a few, this optimised the storage. I loaded all those applications that I usually use but still the external 16 GB remains up utilised. The front and back camera are very good, it feels very comfortable to hold as well. My conclusion, you have to optimise the phone and learn to use it, and this becomes an excellent phone. 3. This is where the conflict, after using Apple IOS from the begning(I shifted from NOKIA very old hand set to iPhone 4s) I am finding android very clumsy and confusing. Simple example, if I have to switch off all notifications at one go, I can do that at one go in Apple, but in android I have to visit each app separately. My final verdict: if you want and excellent phone for usual office use with all relevant apps go for Moto G 2nd gen. Purely from operational perspective it is excellent value for money. Disclaimer: Apple vs android is my personal opinion/perception, and hence I do not want to argue which one is better.",

            "comment": "This is my Review for Moto G2 after using it for 2 months Display: It has good display.Video quality is very sharp with great brightness. Despite having gorilla glass 3 i have got a very small scratch on screen near bottom speaker.Great sensitivity , moto has rocked it. 5inch display is perfect for one hand use. Camera: Rear Camera of moto g2 is decent than many other phones in same price range. Camera interface is simple,effective and very easy to use.You need accurate settings for best pics from g2.Flash with auto settings hardly works so its up to u to keep it on or off. Front Camera is 2mp which is very below average.It is pretty laggy.Hope they fix it in lollipop update. Speakers: Call quality is best in G2.With dual front speakers call quality is much better this category and phones in range of 25k-30k. Listening to music is great experiance. Watching video is amazing with front speakers though not as premium as HTC Dual boom speaker phones. Performance: Best Performance in this category. 1.2ghz processor not the best but great performer as original moto g1. Most of games with medium or high quality graphics played good in likes of Dead Trigger,NFS Most Wanted,Dark Knight Rises,Batman Arkham Origins. Performance gets laggy when 3G downloads are multitasked with games or other apps. Connectivity: Connectivity of moto g2 is satisfactory.WiFi works great.Bluetooth and Gps work fine. Moto G2 is worst for 2G users.You should either have 3G or WiFi for good,better or best experience on g2. Inbuilt apps like gmail,chrome,firefox,opera,play store,google drive,facebook,Google search dont even work on 2G . They always say no connection with 2G i.e,GPRS or EDGE. Memory: It has 12gb internal memory.I use that for just Apps. I got myself 32gb sandisk ultra external microSD card in G2 for videos and music. Software: Pure Android which is just amazing.Using Kitkat 4.4.4 from day one which is great OS especially with phones with 1Gb RAM or less.I thought G2 will get Lollipop update in Nov 2014 but it hasnt arrived yet.Main reason is Motorola's Nexus 6 deal with Google stopping other moto phones from get 5.0.1 andriod update.Just hoping them to give us soon. Accessories: Headphones provided by moto are worst.They are equal to some china headphones with price 60Rs. on streets.I got myself a skullcandy headphone which works fantastic moto G2.Moto should learn from Sony about providing accessories. Battery: Worst Battery performance ever is in Moto G2.Its not just my phones , I have seen 2-3 g2's with worst battery performance.If 3G or WiFi is on constantly battery drains very fast.If brightness is medium or high it drains very fast.You need to keep ur phone on 2G for better battery performance but again no many apps work on 2G . With playing high end games battery will come from 100% to 30% in just 1 hour.Battery drains in medium rate during watching HD videos or playing music. You either have to carry charger with u or power bank with you.G2 needs atleast 2 charging for a single day i.e.15 hours with videos,music,3G,wifi,nearing no gaming. Hoping moto to improve battery performance in lollipop update. Motorola forgot that moto g2 is 5inch phone it is not 4.5inch moto g1 with both having same 2070mah battery which is enough for G1 but not enough for G2. Conclusion: It is great phone at great price with brand value than those who are no brand value like xiaomi or micromax.Good Smartphone go for it.",

Being part of motorola for over a decade, i know the stringent process they follow. Over all happy with phone and any one wanting to buy a \"STOCK ANDROID\" phone please go for it. Your device will be fist to get the latest android updates... As this phone takes in micro sim i got one of my SIM cut and one exchanged with micro sim from AIRTEL. But the experiment worked out, i see a 50% drop on the cut sim compared with real micro SIM. So please spare some extra bucks and get a micro sim rather than cutting it. As usual got the delivery in flash time booked on an Wednesday afternoon and got it Thursday morning 9.00 am at my door steps. Keep it up Flipkart !!!",

P.S. I compared the screen of both the phones delivered to me with the moto g 2nd gen of my freind who bought it 3-4 months back and he has a perfect white screen.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone on two months back, after lot of research ,reading reviews from flipkart and other phone review sites, but i would like to point out few issues which you will find only after you use and will not find in many review sites. I am an average user, not many games, just online news reading and video watching and general use. Firstly pros- 1. Sleek and attractive design. 2.Good Cam(Above Average, low light images are also decent) 3.Sound clarity good(people had complained about it, but sound is quite loud and enough.) 4.Performance is spectacular,any no. of apps can be loaded and it will perform superbly. Hardly ever the phone had hanged. 5.Display is excellent. 6.GPS is excellent Now, cons: 1. I am not able to save any apps or media on sd card, i don't understand why the provision is there when u can't use it.(of course u can save cam pics and videos on it, but not downloaded videos or music.To do so you have to root the device with some app, but I was sceptical, so i didn't.) 2.Battery backup is the main problem with this phone, if you didnt recharge your phone to full capacity before leaving for office, then you are in trouble.Full battery hardly lasts for 16hrs,(with No data usage, that may be because of connectivity issues). 3.If the phone gets switched off , some times it happens that it will not switch on even after charging for 15-20 mins, apparently there is some calibration problem with the phone.(This u will not find in any review sites.) 4. If the face of the phone is placed touching the body part in pocket, it gets heated up to uncomfortable levels, this is scares me at times. 5. You can't assign your favorite song as ringtone,this is annoying and i dont know why, even basic phones have this facility. 6. I noticed battery performance is good on wifi than on 3g.(this may be common) It is better to go for lumia phones by spending an extra 2-3k rupees. Hope this is useful.",

I get around 5 hours of screen on time on 3g, which is decent I guess, nothing spectacular. Apps load snappily, but it has only 1 GB of memory so yeah, apps will restart at times while multitasking, if you have a lot of them open. If you like stock android, you'll love this phone. A very good buy for the price. If you're buying this phone, don't bother getting a screen guard, been using it without one for 3 months and not a single scratch. (This doesn't make it shatterproof though, get a case if you have clumsy hands!). Survived more than a couple of drops, but I doubt if the screen will hold up if I drop it face down, like any other phone it will probably shatter. The screen is sharp, alright in bright light, but viewing angles are pretty poor although it's an IPS LCD. Display colours and crisp and natural looking, no oversaturated nonsense. This is one of the few phones were I noticed the auto brightness works perfectly. Still waiting for the lollipop update though, you'd think Motorola phones would be the first to receive it (after Nexus) but it's January already. :/",

Once again thanks for quicker delivery. After 23 days of usage, touch screen at the bottom does not work and I see in the black background the screen gets fading out. I was very much satisfied with Flipkart since started using from 2012 and nowadays very much totally disappointed with flipkart products about the product quality. I DOUBT WHETHER FLIPKART IS SELLING GENUINE PRODUCTS or it's Moto G Made in China causing product issues being Flipkart the major imported of Moto products. Have raised a ticket on this issue. IF I AM NOT GETTING SATISFACTORY SOLUTION I WOULD BETTER PREFER RETURN THE PRODUCT AND GET MY 13K MONEY REFUNDED. Kind attention to new buyers: Better go to the stores and buy the products.",

PROS: 1>the 294ppi display is a mesmerizing thing to look at, very good viewing angles, and very crisp display. 2> 1.2 GHZ quad core processer is a mighty beast, can run multiple apps without any lag. 3> the Adreno GPU is just a delight, all recent high end games work (but best in medium settings. ) 4> Camera... where do i even begin, the 8MP snapper is the standout feature of this device, can record videos in 720p only but that is not a let down, images captured are brilliant and very much comparable to a low end dslr... the front cam is just the icing on the cake images are just as good. 5> Storage is greatly improved with the provision of SD card Slot. 6> recharging time, is greatly reduced, from a standard charger supplied, the device charges in little less than 90 Mins. a very good thing.. CONS: 1> Battery could have been better, the 2070mah battery last's only for 13-15 hrs, even on moderate internet usage. 2> the Available RAM should have been atleast 1.5 GB, not that it is a major problem ... 3> I noticed the charger heats up at times, not sure if a faulty charger, or due to quick charging... OVERALL: a good buy, definitely go for it, wont be disappointing.",

My phone went for a royal toss and I had to return the product. But hey that happens and Flipkart was just awesome to give me a replacement within the next 2 days. Its a good phone after all. Not every phone works!! Now that I have my new phone, let me provide my views:- Pros:- Smooth and fast browsing (facebook and whatsapp is just super smooth to use) Thanks to Kitkat. Camera is just awesome (front and back) Almost every game can be played. Amazing skype experience. Voice clarity is simply superb and it doesn't hurt the ear. The headphones provided serves the purpose really well. And yes it can be upgraded to Lollipop. Easy to hold, and mainly easy to type. (Did not find any difficulty) Huge internal memory of 16GB and SD card upto 64 GB Cons:- Battery life is very less. And the fact that it is inbuilt makes it a lot more skeptical. (Make sure you own a power bank). As mentioned above, DO NOT SWITCH ON the TALK BACK FEATURE. Getting connected to a computer might be a bit of a confusion at the beginning but I am sure people will get used to it within a day or two. On the whole a very good product that is worth your money spent! Go for it. You will not regret!!!!",

Superb performance. 4. No lags. 5. 16GB internal memory external slot available. 6. Good display. Cons: 1. The only bad thing I can say about this is that the speakers aren't too great. Yes, they can provide surround sound effect but only upto a very small range. So the only negative would be the Speakers. I would definitely tell others to buys this.",

The problem is solved after a device restart, but it reappears again after some time. And also I got a damaged back shell. The former problem , i think its a software problem as the speakers are fine during media playback & the problem is only during the calls. However I have initiated a replacement request and my replacement is on its way. I'll put the detailed review after i recieve the replacement. Till now I'm satisfied with the flipkart service. Overall Review: * Build Quality is superb * Stereo speakers give superb audio experience * Battery is Average * Camera is awsome for this price( Both Front and Rear) * Phone is more handy compared to other phones with 5\" display * RAM should've been better, But can't complain because of its budget price * Proceesor is awesome ... No lag in response found * Display is of premium quality compared to phones in similar price range * Pure Android experience ( No much useful apps from MOTO) * Can't change the font style without rooting , Unlike from Samsung phones * No Overheating experienced * 13GB is available for apps ( Theres no app specific memory, user can use the memory according to them , that is for apps or media. * Charger that came with the phone is dissapointing as its so slow in charging (take nearly 4 hours for a full charge) and it heats too much",

I can play The Maze runner without any lag (I like the game). Pros : 1. Great look . 2. Photo quality is superb 3. Screen size is perfect 4.Screen resolution is high 5. Fabulous performance Cons: 1. Battery backup 2. Callers voice can be heard outside I guess because of stereotype speaker. I recommend this phone to my friends as I have not found any issues which annoyed me.",

Flipkart is taking an advantage since they are the only authorised sellers for this Phone -MotoG I ordered a phone on 30-Dec'14 was wanting it so much that i even opted for a speedy delivery by am extra payment. I receive the phone on 31-Dec'14 and to my great surprise i see that the SIM Slot2 is damaged...which left me dumstruck not even wanting to use the phone any longer, i report the case immediately to the customer care who are so negligent...each one of them just want to pass the ball from their court..thats all is what they are concerned abt; wanting me to wait for call from the tech team for the next 24hrs who will then understand what is my concer...Is this how they treat the customers when they adverstise for their products???? ...i receive a call at 10.30am i-Jan'15; when i am in a meeting hence ask the technical exceutive to stay on line for 10min,refuses to do so and offers call back at 11am and the story ends there..... i don receive any call after that...and i callback the tech team multiple times to hear their slogan.. \"We are sorry for the inconvinience the issue is escalated they will call u in nxt 24hrs however we cannot assure the call back today\". Am fed up hearing the some thing i even doubt if this is recorded..... Since i din want to use the damaged phone i did not even check the box and frustrated with their service when i finally decide to use the phone with the SIM Slot1 working, i notice that even the headsets are missing!!!!!! and the phone ordered is black in colour and the only available accessory is the charger which is white in colour",

I got 3000 Rs for the old phone which was very good. I have been using this phone for more than a week PROS: 1) Screen Resolution is Amazing and 5 inch phone looks very good. I have compared it to Nexus 5 and Moto G2 looks 80 percent of Nexus 5 - 5/5 2) Camera clarity is simply mind blowing and its a awesome 8MP Rear camera. - 5/5 3) Front Speakers are good - 4/5 4) Response time is very good and apps open immediately and no lag is found - 5/5 5) Gaming - Played Temple run 2 and subway surfer without any hiccups - 5/5 6) Lollipop - Eagerly waiting for lollipop Upgrade. CONS: BATTERY: Battery is average. For every 3min of internet browsing you will loose 1% of battery and Moto g 2 should have provided 3000mAH Battery. But is is far better than iphone 4. I have installed Battery Saver App and after that Iam able to control the Battery. Also bought MI Powerbank so Iam relieved and does not have check my battery all the time. Eagerly waiting for lollipop Upgrade and maybe battery condition will improve",

The only difference between the two phones is the battery backup which is better in the 1st Gen. External slot doesn't really matter, because they DO harm the phone in many ways. I too would have bought the G2 but what held me back are the speakers.. If Motorola would have continued the same model with just the size update, it would have been so much better. Those speakers are really ugly !! I just hope Motorola Mobility or Lenovo, whoever wears the pants in the family now does not continue with those speakers for the next phone to be released by them, and even if they do please manufacture with a colour like metallic grey which camouflages those speakers. To sum it up, MotoG2 is still the real MVP !!!",

So if you are looking for a good brand phone with maximum features and good battery backup go for MOTO G 2nd Gen. ** I will soon be getting Android Lollipop on My MOTO G 2nd GEN. Also MOTO G 2nd GEN battery charges very quickly ( within 1-1.5 hours 100% ) and lasts for nearly 24 hours at moderate usage. (other features are already mentioned by many buyers).

Problems running super heavy graphics intensive games like ShadowGun. havent received 5.0 lollipop update till 31/12/2014 but I am eagerly waiting for it.",

Ram is only 1 GB instead of giving 2 GB.otherwise in midrage price phone.This is the best Phone",

            "comment": "After 6 days of use, I find Moto G is excellent phone by Motorola which is the first company to make cellular phones. Motorola is also American company (recently bought by Google), you can compare its build quality with Apple. I also happen to have Ipad Mini 2 Retina display. 1. Phone function 5/5 Clear audio quality. I used to get poor signal with my old Samsung Galaxy R at home but now that problem is solved. Thanks to Android 4.4.4 you have simplified view of contacts, call log. But message log and call log are separate. Nowadays sms use is lesser. Hardly anyone mentions this feature which is still very relevant today. Many high end phones have complicated calling function. 2. Display 5/5 294 ppi to be exact. Small fonts can be read without eye strain. My Ipad Mini 2 Retina has 324 ppi and you CAN'T tell difference. Now there are phones with 500 ppi displays, but you won't notice these tiny pixels beyond human eye capacity. 3. Battery 4/5 I get upto 2 days as my use is less. But heavy user can get a day's backup. 4. Camera 5/5 Impressive photos in low light. Takes multiple shots per second!! It makes sure you get a perfect snap in sports or when moving speedily. 5. Original Android, Google now 5/5 6. White LED notification Good feature for those who don't check phone constantly. You can set for just personal message in WhatsApp or a missed call etc. 7. Build quality 5/5 Better than Samsung, close to Apple but without metallic back. 8. Design 5/5 Slightly curved back with matte finish helps gripping. Phone is not too thin. Too thin phones are difficult to hold. My Ipad is thin and slightly uneasy to hold. Other important features are Gorilla glass, Android 5 update, Motorola brand. And it is almost a 'budget' phone costing 13k. Only thing is to be seen is how Motorola service is. I hope it will hardly be needed.",

I've been using for over 3 months.. till now no issues like hanging or heating as such other than battery running out soon when using 3G network.. but that's just androids & Moto's way of telling you keep your charger close by.. phone comes loaded with most of the features which are generally abundant in all other brands so not much to tell.. camera is decent so is the dual stereo speakers.. they are loud but who plays music on mobile phone speakers other than plug the headphones.. the packaging comes very simple & there's no data cable which is a big negative point if you don't have any lying around.. I already had 2-3 so no worries there.. the headphones provided inside are very basic variety you would do better to buy a good one separately, I use Tekfusion Twinwoofers with Poweramp so music listening is awesome... picture quality is clear & bright even when the brightness is turned down a lot... i dont use any screen guard as the screen comes with gorilla glass 3 which does its work pretty decently... till now no nudges or scratches on the phone or maybe I keep my phone safe from all that.. Flipkart delivery was late by 2 days but packaging was good... overall a good phone to invest.. Update - Ok, after upgrading to Android Lollipop.. I've noticed severe drop in battery life.. Now a full charge lasts max 5-8 hour with just music listening & minor surfing on 3G & whatsapp & fb chat app.. I use a separate cell for phone calls... earlier it would last at least 16 hours.. upgrading to lollipop has sure made the UI look much cooler but the battery life is something to be wondered about, Motorola should look into it asap..",

I am moderate user (not a gaming freek) and the phone is going quite well for me except many minor but irritating drawbacks. Pros: 1. Master piece in price range 2. Looks extremly good (I baught black color handset with two additional orignal back cover and it looks great) 3. Does'nt hang in moderate usage (m not gaming freek but dozen of app runs in my phone all the time) 4. Latest andriod OS 5. Camera is fast 6. Good quality sound. Cons: 1. Camera is not great in night/dull light. What it shows in display is not as same as what it captures. 2. Zoom in / Zoom out pinch gesture is irritating and doesn't work smoothly. Issue with the default app. 3. SPEAKERS CANNOT BE TURN ON while listening to RADIO. (not sure if this is the hardware issue or the default app issue) 4. Some time while listening to music on headphones if you eject to move to speakers, it does'nt work or there is a reduction in volume. you need to pause and resume and speakers starts working. 5. Buttons on earphone (call pick/drop/change song/adjust volume) does'nt work. 6. Ear phones shipped with the product is of cheap quality. 7. There is NO NEXTLINE KEY in the keyboard. (not sure it is OS issue, I am usnig 4.4.4) This makes extremly unpleasent while texting. Thanks!",

Processor: No upgrade in processor but still a snappy device. No hiccups or crashes with day to day app usage. OS: Near pure android experience which i love very much. Waiting for Lollypop 5.0 Camera: Decent camera. Images are noisy (grainy) in less light. Flash is Ok types.

It's 5\" HD display is great fonts are crisp all the icons where clear in good color. Screen can be viewed from any angle and does not inverts the colours thanks to IPS LCD display. Its 1.2 GHz Quad Core power pack is really fast and does not lags at all with 1 GB RAM and 16 GB Internal and has a micro SD card slot. I installed almost 20 apps in it with a ease and it does not lags. Its 8MP rear and 2MP front camera are impressive and able to click some really nice shots. In a nutshell, its a good phone to buy and recommends this to all. And also thanks to Flipkart for introducing this great smartphone",

I purchased this mobile on EMI.. on Delivery day they called me and asked where I'm? I told in some abc restaurant then they requested we'll come to that restaurant with-in half-an hour not to your address, just coz restaurant is on the way to my home so no need to travel up-to my home (Called at 12:30PM, even they have car) I told okay(I told YES just because they requested a lot). after that I waited 2 hours in that restaurant, They dint come I gone to my home(2PM). After half-an hour(2:30PM) they called and told we'll be at that restaurant with-in 5 minutes. I told I waited for 2 hours now deliver to my home. They told No, If you want come else sorry. We can't come to your address. I gone to that abc restaurant again. There he's scolding me just coz I was not there and told we are gonna return back your product to flipkart by signing \"Customer's Unavailable\" if it happens again. OMG!!! I'm really confused.. In phone he requested he can't come up-to my home address and now he's blaming for the change of address. I'm really requesting flipkart people to tell Ekart delivery guys Just to deliver to given address not calling and requesting to come to some other places just because they can't travel far. Because we guys are already paid money through Debit/Credit cards and waiting for products. from now on I'll do cash on delivery. If something like this happens next time I'm gonna return the product. In that case blame your delivery guys not buyers. Packaging was so good from flipkart and the offers what they given for that smartphone I got it. Thanks flipkart except in the matter of delivery guys. My 2 stars for flipkart and product. Delivery guys are completely horrible.",

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because all I needed was an android default launcher for Android vr.4.4.4 but all other moto system upgrades,the default launcher will be replaced with the google now launcher. Although its not a demerit I have checked it completely and found it to be a useful device... What I checked that other critics or buyers were saying a lot about its low voice from speakers, not so good display and a bad battery backup. i) My Moto g (2nd Generation) has an awesome display with everything good-> brightness, contrast, colors etc. ii) My Moto G2 has an amazing voice clarity form speakers even if I listen to any music or play any game (RipTide GP 2). iii) My Moto G2 with 100% battery lasts upto 6-8 hours if continuously used. Its a merit cause as fas as I have tested so many android phones, they doesn't lasts for even 5 hours when used continuously. If you can afford it, then you should buy it, cause its the best among the bests. Although it has a good competitor that is, hTC 616, but still I'll advice you to buy this..... As already said that it is, \"Best out of bests\". Even a title to Moto G1 was given by so many magazines and newspapers, it was, \"POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS\", so Moto G2 can be easily titled as \"POOR PEOPLE's NEXUS6 \". I guarantee.",

From the day one, i have been facing a issue of battery backup - hardly four to five hours. Now, its time to reinvest in mobile phone as some couple of other problem developed - like slow response/ delay response. If you are looking for good battery life & faster response - it would be advisable to look for all other options",

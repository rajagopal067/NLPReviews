Also mobile gets heated up while playing games or watching a movie more than 30 mins. If you are an android phone lover with previous experience, you will hate this phone. If you are new to android mobiles then go for it. Also camera picture quality is not up to the mark. Front cam is okay when compared to rear Cam though it got more mega pixels.",

About Moto G2: Pros: 1) Very speed set and never hangs or stucks for even 1 sec.. 2) Camera clarity and pixel is superb cool...slomo is really nice....but if sound is available, it would be better.... 3) Touch is very good and smooth enough to use... Cons: 1) The only cons in this phone is that we cannot peg internet connection to 3G only mode. It drags us to 2G automatically if the network is not strong in the location. Very rare to get 3G in it...Dont worry users if you want to use 3G only data in this set follow this below procedure as I did and it worked for me....thats y i have rated 5 stars for this mobile and to Flipkart as well...... How to force 3G only mode: 1)Go to your Phone/Dialer app and dial the following USSD code: *#*#4636#*#* 2)A popup window will open something 3)Select the first option from the list that appears i.e. Phone Information 4)Scroll down till you get to the Set preferred network type heading. By default, it might be on GSM only (i.e. 2G only) or WCDMA preferred (i.e. 3G preferred). Change this option to WCDMA only and your phone will automatically switch to 3G only mode. 5) Unless you understand what you are doing, don't tweak any other option in this menu as it can lead to problems. If you are having a dual sim phone, you can go to Wireless and Networks >> More >> Mobile Networks >> 3G service and select which sim you want to activate 3G on.",

There are a lot of saliet features missing in the phone, like customization by SIM, viewing the phone list is not easy, clearing the log clears everything and you have to go go into 2 step process and sometimes 3 step process. My final advice is to stay away from this phone as much as possible and Flipkart is trying to clear its stock as fast as possible",

But actually product came to my district place which doesnt fall in the Pincode I given, which is around 40 Kms away from my place. Then delivery guy calls and says you come and pick the product else leave it. I wanna know whose mistake is this? The worst part in all of this is, it was a surprised birthday gift for my dad who lives in my native place and I live in Bangalore. So what should i say to dad that \"Please go and collect the surprised gift which I have sent to you by travelling 80 Kms two way\" Ridiculous. :@ Some thing should be dealt with sensitivity. You must understand that Flipkart!!. I would not have placed that if you guys haven't shown me that delivery is available. \"Dont ask the Pincode for verification to check whether you have delivery service or not, when you really dont bother.\" Top of all this, there were 4 to 5 escalations for this product to resolve and nothing happened. And I was kept on hold for almost 45 minutes in the process of transferring call to senior officials. It all ended up asking my cousin to pick up the product and asked him present my dad. :( Not even a courtesy call after the delivery.",

This is my first Smartphone, so feel proud to I have Moto g2 which looks really cool and fantastic.As of now i did't get any issue. Some Important point:- -Camera quality is very good as compare to other phone like Yu-Yureka & other. -Performance is to good, as of now I download all required apps and didn't any issue like heating, hanging. Phone is performing really well. -No heating issue like Mi4i, Yureka. -Battery backup is also good. If you used normal then its for 12-16 hours. If you continuously 3G or gaming its drains quickly its for 6 hours normally. Only I found that its take lot time to charged full aroud 3-4 hours. -Overall it is a very good phone. So, Go for it friends, because Moto G2 is trust-able smartphone. Not having that much issue.",

Offers you countless features and the Corning Gorilla Glass is silky smooth with the brightest and smartest appearance. A great point to be noted is that as soon as you get your phone and switch it on, its gonna ask you for the Android upgrade to Lollipop(make sure you have your Wi-Fi on) and it updates within seconds. Provides you an exceptional battery back-up and a sleek rear cover. Also the screen is massive, bigger than the 1st Gen model. So folks, just go for it!",

The design - Sleek, elegant; never felt bulky in spite of the near 11 mm thickness and the 150 grams. In my opinion, the black color suited the design well. 2. Screen lock button - Low profile and firm - helped prevent accidental dialing. 3. Notification light, aptly designed and helpful. 4. Display - This is where it scores the max. Vivid, with good color depth and crisp lines. 5. Graphics - Smooth and lag free. Fluid transition between menus and windows. 6. Call clarity - Loud and clear, without cracking or buzzing, on both the earphones and the speaker, as well. 7. OS - This phone came with Android 5.0.2, which was delightfully devoid of unnecessary apps. The interface was a refreshing change, and the performance was good. 8. Battery life - Well, it lasted a maximum of about 40 hours with calling, messaging, surfing and online apps, on 3G, hence quite decent. 9. Camera - The clarity of the primary camera is really good for 8 MP. Best when shot in natural light. 10. It did get warm while charging; no overheating, though. Cons: 1. No data cable provided with the phone. 2. The lack of a file manger. I had to get one from the PlayStore, which obviously came at the cost of ads. 3. No useful PC/Mac interface. The Motorola Device Manager merely checks for updates to the phone software. Overall, I would say that the Moto G 2nd offered great value for money in comparison with other phones in its class.",

It got a android update to lollipop but since then mobile data stopped working. So i contacted the Support staff ( online and Service center) 1. Service center makes me visit every week but every time tell me by next week we will provide u d software to resolve ur issue. 2. Ever time i call the online support they make me dictate the issue and then tell contact service center. 3. We i tell them that service center cant help they tell me to wait for 24- 48 hours. 4 but after waiting i get a mail stating that since we haven't heard from u so we consider the issue resolved. 5 then i have to make the call again , and have to make fun of my self by repeating the issue and i get the same response.

Despite this my product was delivered very late compared to the products in which I keep cash on delivery option . The customer care too was very irresponsible and used to give me lame excuse all the time I called to them. The more the flipkart grows in user number the more it takes the customers lightly. The product is good and works fine. Battery backup is also good . The touch is also very smooth . Response of apps is also good. I am happy with the product. I recommend buying it if you are asking for a good phone around 13k price range .",

Also it gets heated quickly during browsing and playing games. This is also not a good sign. Now there are lot of options to buy high config phones comparing to this with same budget.",

Brand its Moto! 2. very good build quality 3. No lags though 1 gb Ram! 4. good call quality. 5. good display n sound quality. 6. affordable price. 7. Stock android Experience Lollipop built in! 8. Dual Sim phone multiple features 9. 16gb internal memory + expandable. cons: 1. Camera not that great yet for this price okay... 2. Battery drains faster 3. 2g slow internet and 3g is okay not impressive . no 4 G 4. no pre installed non google apps like whatsapp, facebook 5. no 2gb ram for game savvy people. 6. higher SAR value",

For this Flipkart checked the mobile by installing Smart Check, but nothing improved. The whole process took nearly 2 months, but as per the return policy, product will be returned with in 1 month only. But as the complaint is registered with in 1 month & the product delivered is defective Flipkart promised to replace it if is defective & asked me to visit a customer care center. Customer care center has confirmed that the product delivered was defective & Flipkart on the discussion initially rejected but after talking to their supervisor replaced the product & delivered in 2 days only. Thanks for the Team.",

I work in the TELECOM field and use the phone for basic activities like Voice calls Whatsapp etc. I dont use gaming or download too many other applications. The phone is very sluggish to move from one menu to another. Many times my contacts complaint that they cant reach me while calling. I observed during such times I cant make outgoing calls either . The phone gets into some kind of Hung state. Solution : Restart phone or Flight mode ON / OFF Last 2-3 days new problem is I cant answer incoming calls. The phone doesn't respond when I touch the Answer button. The screen sensitivity is ok as I tested other apps in the same area of screen, it works. Solution : I can lock the screen and unlock this time I can answer . Thinking of what next to do !!!!!",

I had already bought a nexus 7 and a nexus 5 from flipkart those products were great no complains at all. BUT this one was a completely different story.. This phone was delivered to me in the 1st week of April I don't exactly remember the date but the problem was sound from its bottom speaker distorted at full volumes. so no issues i requested for replacement. i had to be on phone with flipkart support for 46 mins just for them to check the phone when all that verification and testing was done they told me My new device will be shipped only when this will be picked up and will reach them. I had no other option to wait. then I received the replacement model on 23rd April and guess what it had the exactly same problem. But this time I did not have the patience to be on the phone with flipkart customer support and explaining the same thing to the same guy over and over again. So i kept the phone did not do anything and i am using it.. its working absolutely fine but the sound distortion problem still persists. Plus I've reduced shopping from flipkart because last 10-12 orders i've placed from flipkart either they were defective or not functioning at all. I bought clothes 2 out of 4 t shirts faded in the 1st wash. I ordered a wireless mouse the package was torn all the way when i received it and the worst part it did not even turn on, i requested a refund that took 16 day. I sincerely request flipkart to improve the quality if they really want to retain their customers. I am certainly not happy and so are not many other loyal buyers.",

Software is brilliant and gives an out of this world experience. Lollipop Android on this handset is like \"Icing on the cake\". All the rest features are also very good and quite amazing. However one upsetting thing about this phone is that it does not have a USB Data cable-cum-Charger which makes user to arrange it from somewhere else also Headset is kind of OK.

With brands like Sony, HTC and Samsung grabbing the android limelight, and the giant killer from One Plus One, Motorola may have a hard time tying to find a clientele. You have to get a feel of it to see, how well built this unit is. It surely gives the midrange units from HTC, Sony and Samsung something to think about. Its well built and its operation is really smooth for 1Gb of RAM. I had recent;y purchased it for a friend who wanted to upgrade from the Samsung Note N7000. He was shocked when he found out how well the unit performed. although he was skeptical at first. My advice, is you gotta try it to believe it.",

CAMERA- Both primary and secondary are decent but not excellent but considering the price its ok. 4. CHARGING- It takes around 3+ hrs from 0-100% with supplied charger. 5. OS- Latest Android LOLLIPOP at its best and simply flawless performance . 6. GAMING- It could many of the games including Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger ,Clash Of Clan etc without any issues at medium graphics . 7. AUDIO OUTPUT- Both the front facing speakers are adequately loud and call quality is good. 8. HEATING- It gets slightly warm on extensive gaming, which is common with all mobiles.

The specification of the phone is good however I can find few mismatches from my expectations. - The \"Cast Screen\" feature (also available explicitly in the pull down drawer) doesn\u2019t work with miracast or Smart TV. You cannot mirror you mobile screen with TV (wirelessly) even when it is supported by Lolipop as it seems to be disabled by Motorola at OS level (based on my Goggling). - The declared Gorilla glass is not of great quality and I have got few scratches on the screen. I recommend taking good care of the screen. If you could not handle screen carefully then buy a good Flip Cover. - For some of the Days, the Phone hangs a lot and couldn\u2019t let you browse through your app. Not sure of the pattern and reason but happens once every two-three days. It is very irritating and not expected from the phone of this specification. Rest all is good and not a completely bad choice for buying.",

Meaning thereby, perhaps there is no option of \"select all\" or for that matter \"select multiple\" Next, I was astonished on noticing that one cannot assign a song from the playlist as a ringtone. You are forced to use default ringtones. In my further discovery, I came across text messages where you are definitely allowed to type but there exists no provision to \"save its as draft\" The absence of \"memo\" and alike makes it so obvious for the need of draft messages. All what I feel is the phone is surely a \"smart phone\" without incorporating some basic much needed features.",

Though you can get better phones from chinese and indian manufacturers at half of this price, this is still the best as it has the best ecosystem of all the accessories and ROMS and other than that it has the best user interface STOCK ANDROID. No other manufacturer can match this quality at this price. Just a little bit dissappointed because of the screen quality when compare to moto g(2013) and also the unknown heating issues when using the camera. And i also feel that motorola has compromised a bit on the quality to cut down the cost. I hope they fix these issues with the 3rd gen moto g. I dont want a full hd screen, neither an octa core processor, i want the same old qualtiy and reliability for which motorola has been known for. Overall, just dont look into chinese products, buy motorola, and upgrade ur phone every 2 years.",

Mobile manufactured by Lenovo , party no- 2 and they said Fourtech computers , ---- party no -1 , is authorized service in pune . After 10 months of date of purchase I found simcard not detected in mobile on 04/04/2015 . Then I deposited mobile in a Fourtech computers four times to solve the same problem on 04/04/2015 , 07/04/2015 , 23/04/2015 and 24 / 04/2015 but they could not repair it permanently. I have attached service record of each time. That time mobile was in warranty period . Now just warranty period was expired on 10.05.2015 & if that problem comes again they will take money from me. Now I don\u2019t believe on lenovo company.",

Please note, I have not installed any apps in the phone so far. So there is no possibility of it getting hanged due to the phone being loaded with apps. My plight does not end here. I requested for a replacement of this phone and it is past 3 weeks but no action has been taken on it. I have not got an SMS from flipkart stating that my replacement has been rejected by the seller -\"We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request. Reason : The issue has been resolved between you and the seller. Hence, there will be no replacement or refund.\" I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I HAVE ORDERED THE REPLACEMENT OF MOTO G2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PURCHASE. I have been given a defective piece and now FLIPKART and WS RETAIL refuse to replace it. PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER. THEY ARE SELLING DFECTIVE PRODUCTS AND THEN REFUSE TO REPLACE IT EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCT IS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF RETURN POLICY.

Google chrome hangs on opening multiple tabs. Occurs quite frequently. Camera quality is very poor compared to any other phone available for above 10K. Nothing in the phone that i can suggest to others to buy. Made a mistake by believing on brands Moto and Flipkart. Guys do read reviews before taking a call to buy this worthless phone",

Not while playing games, or while flipping between multiple applications. Both the front and rear cameras are good with solid low light imaging. The phone is a tad heavy, but it adds to its charm. It feels sturdy to hold, and needless to say, the gorilla glass requires no screen cover. Phone itself is a thing of beauty. Up till now, I have no regrets. Upgraded to 5.0 the moment I started it(I have WiFi,so). Buy it. You won't regret it even once.",

However, people who might have received a defective product would probably share their experience because it is not satisfactory. Hence , this gives an image of the product that may be it is buggy and has lot of issues. I bought this phone ,was worried it could be buggy since it came with Lollipop Pre-loaded , but wasnt .

Purchased it from Flipkart and got the phone at price of Rupees 8,999.00 but had an issue with 2nd sim slot. had to return and got a new one. The phone has major issue with its heating problem and battery. Heat - It heats up after 15-20 minuets of internet use or game. Battery - battery could be better. Come on, for 5\" Screen 2070 Mah battery is not enough.... but it will give u full day with minimal usages. Else everything is cool like display is awesome and touch also cool.... Front Camera is Very good with 2 M.P. Primary Camera is Very Good with outdoor Photos not with indoor photos. Gaming graphics is Very good with no lag. It's stock android so interface is Very good but for me My previous Sony UI interface was better than this one as it was a customized UI. Overall I will give 3 Star to MOTO G 2nd gen with all Pros and cons. Hope my review will help you guys to chose the best one. Thanks.",

The camera music player and all are pretty good. The camera infact is pretty impressive for a point and shoot and portrait photography. The other useful features are of course having the latest android (Not too impressed with Android lollipop though), 16GB Internal memory plus the option of extending the memory with a memory stick (earlier Moto G lacked this) and features like moto assist, google synchronization to display all my calendar entries, travel/play/movie bookings, etc. Plus there is no bloatware stuffed by Motorola. Battery life is also very decent. Only thing lacking is a detachable charger. Also there is no USB cable provided alongwith the phone for data transfer. Not sure why Motorola has done this? Otherwise I have no complains. The screen size, display and overall feel of the phone material is very good. All in all a handy phone and can be bought for the wonderful price that it is offered at.",

I had lot of respect for the professionalism flipkart shows in selling/delivering/addressing problems of the customers. Now it is not there anymore. The latest phone which I have recieved had number of issues. 1. No voice clarity: The speaker makes crackling noise. This is the problem seen in 3 out of 4 phones I purchased(only 1 phone is good). Two are to be replaced by flipkart after lot of struggle/discussion with customer care. The latest one I recieved is the worst of all. The noise is so much that I cant listen what the other person is speaking. 2. Top speaker of the phone is not working: There are two speaker one on the top and another at the bottom. Top speaker doesnt work at all. 3. Camera quality is bad: The phone has 8 mp camera, but it is worse than 5 mp camera of any samsung phone. Pixellation is seen in the images. The worst part is yet to come. I have given complaint about all these to flipkart, 3 times till now. There is no proper response. First time I recieved a call. They spoke some thing which I could not listen because of problem in the phone. I asked them to call back again. They didnot call. I raised second complaint. they called me and told that they will send a service person within 2 days. No body turned up even after 3 days. Not even anyone called. Today I raised third complaint. I dont know whether they will settle the matter or not? This experiance made me to lose my confidence not only on moto phones but also on flipkart. I am not a flipkart fan any more. Thank you flipkart. I cannot rate this experiance as zero, so rated with one star.",

I heard good things about the Moto G 2nd gen phone, and bought two--one for myself and ome for my daugter. Flipkart service was prompt, no complaints there. The phone looks and feels beautiful but within four months of buying it, I could not hear well. I took it to the service centre, which was very far from my home. In Kolkata, Motorola's service centres are far from the city centre. And the service at the Diamond Harbour Road service centre is horrible. They couldn't care less that you are travelling more than an hour in terrible heat and humidity to get your new phone serviced. Once you have bought the phone, it is your worry even if this is well within the one-year warranty period of the phone. Worse, within a week of getting it serviced, the phone showed the same problem. Within a couple of days, it developed a new problem: the screen started heating up. Unfortunately for me, the second time I sent it to the service centre, my husband suddenly fell very ill and went into a coma. He was in ICU and I had no phone. Can you imagine how stressful that is? The service centre, however, was unfazed. They still took a week more to repair it. When it was done, I had to go and collect it, taking out half a day for this while my husband was still in hospital. The same day I collected it, I realised the problem of not being able to hear still persisted. Seven days later, the problem of the heated screen has started again. I have complained again, only I haven't had the time to take the phone to the service centre yet. Not once has Motorola offered to replace the phone. Even after three rounds of complaints within just 6 months of buying it. Once you buy their phone, it's your problem.",

(well i don''t expect wonders at this price but i always prefer more RAM) considering everythin i should say its a value for money phone with awesome features for a regular user. So, for a budget phone for 11-15k. Just dont think much and just go for it! :)",

But replacing the screen was costly so i purchased this mobile. G2 is an average phone who fond of big screen at reasonable price. Pros: 1. Screen size is big 2. Believe this phone does not get much heat when u play game for long time 3. Camera is good but not much compared with Carl Zeiss powered windows phone but still photos are good. 4. Android kitkat / lollypop is good and rarely gets hangs or jerked. 5. Audio is good especially loudspeaker works like a speaker phone Cons 1.Poor battery life and the charger came with phone is poor it takes so much time to get charge the phone. battery drains quickly as i used with windows phone (lollipop draws power) 2. Headphone came with the mobile worth for 100 Rs only no effect.. i am using JBL to get more pleasnt sound 3. i feel lollipop os should be better, it should have a single place to see notifications and quick buttons.. first swipe to see notifications and second swipe to see the quick launch buttons 4. Android os is not good during incoming calls it displays incoming call notificaiton at top of screen which is irritating 5. display which should have been better, its just lcd not amoled screen, need to have more brightness sometimes Its a average phone and its okay for the bucks spent.",

Atlast I was forced to switch to MotoG2 based on the price differences. I had a very bad experiences seeing the mobile delivered had a screen defect with bright white spot in the screen, which was disturbing and had to replace it immediately. To my disappointment I was put to delayed formalities and I had to wait for 1 week due to online check delay. Once done I had my Moto G2 replaced and found to be a good performer. Its a good choice for the price , i feel the camera is not to mark with 8 mp especially the quality is not very good when its taken with zoom. with all the price matters, I feel good with these thoughts.. overall a GOOD choice.",

After buying this product please register your product at Motorola official website support and get the information about the security of the mobile as it has the best feature to trace(which other mobile doesn't have) your mobile in case if you lost it. Finally I can say that this mobile has good features which you can't get in any other brands. So I suggest people to go with it. Here is the mobile(Lenovo A6000 plus) which has best features than this mobile but I am not sure about the review on it as it is released at the month end of April. Its price(Lenovo A6000 plus) is also less in Flipkart",

I used this phone with Kitkat for around 1 month and it was awesome but as soon as I upgrade it to Lolipop it became an ordinary phone. I don't know I should blame google to launch such a garbage IOS (specially google now launcher in Lolipop) or I should blame Motorola guys who simply pushed Lolipop to this phone without even testing it with Moto G2. At the end of the day I would say Phone is good at this price and if one can compromise with some lag and battery backup (which comes once phone gets upgraded to Lolipop) then go ahead.. Also Lolipop 5.0.2 has some bugs which I experience while using my phone. Have a good one.. :) Note: Overall rating is not for Flipkart, it's for the phone after using it for 6 months.",

Restarting the phone helped, but that's not what you want a multi-tasking phone to ask you to do? - 1GB RAM is not sufficient for people who like to install many social media apps. - Night shots are bad, even with the flash. - Using 2 SIM's can just make the phone a dud with multiple apps - No 4G (even Moto E has 4G now) I would say buy this phone if your purpose in only I/C and O/G with a couple of social media apps like WA, FB & Instagram. It would be wise to wait for the Moto G 3rd Gen, which I guess may boast a much needed 2GB RAM and 4G LTE!",

The Pros and Cons are - Pros 1) Good battery life. Lasts for about 2 days with normal usage (1 day if you play a lot of games etc.) 2) Great Screen for watching Movies or YouTube and doesn't give a lot of glare. 3) Sturdy Build and feels really nice in your hands with the rubberised back. 4) Expandable storage 5) Amazing Android Experience 6) Good and responsive Touchscreen. Doesn't really require a screen guard but I would recommend you to use one. 7) Good sound quality. Its not Amazing but still, good speakers. Prefer to use Earphones 8) Fast Charging. You can get a full charge in 3 hours or less. Cons 1) 1 GB RAM isn't too great for a lot of heavy games. Gives lag if you have a lot of apps on multi-tasking. But if you have normal usage, its pretty good. 2) In-the-box Earphones are not so good. 3) Screen gets a lot of fingerprints unless you use a screen guard. 4) You probably cant get a lot of fancy Cases and Covers for it. All in all its worth its money and a really good product. If you want to play A LOT of games and movies and use a lot of apps, then you might need a better RAM. But for ordinary usage (music, social media, calling, a few movies, a few games, videos etc), its good enough.",

Needs twice a charging per day if you are a serious gamer. Network - not quite difference, it doesn't matters if you are on wifi or 3g, draining time is the same. Entertainment - quite good while listening music but not while watching movies, still OK while watching a 20min TV series. Web Browsing/Multitasking - no issue at all. Takes about couple of hours max to charge it fully. Overall I would say not at all bad for a 2070mAh battery. Got Android Lollipop 5.0.2 straight out of the box.",

Internal Memory is not accessible through the default app available, You have install some other third party app to access your internal memory and SD card. Some unnecessary Google App is there, instead of the useful ones. Sound quality is also not good, if you want to watch a movie, you have to use a head phone, otherwise sound is not audible properly, that \"FULL STEREO SOUND\" is just an eye wash. While making a phone call the speaker sound is not audible from 0.5 ft distance properly. And if speaker is enabled, proximity sensor is not working. Didn't expect this type of quality from Motorola. Camera is good, but takes longer time to get the focus. Front camera angle is not that wide. Good thing is it's vibrant display. Before this I have used Samsung Y Duos, I though it(MOTO) would be better that this but not. Utterly disappointed.",

Graphics is too good in MOTO G2, after Lollipop upgrade the looks changed, Ambient display feature available which will adjust the brightness automatically according to the surrounding. 2.Battery backup awesome..at least 24 hours with 4 hours 3g usage in variable network. It will take exact 4 hours to charge fully from 0 percent to 100 percent, that means 25% charge gain in 1 hour. 3.Camera is of good quality. 4.Speaker quality is also very good. I've mentioned these all features of MOTO G2, and I believe in that price this is the best phone in market. Don't think a lot........just go for it and be happy :)",

I am buying product on flipkart since a few years now, first time I had to actually seek the help from support as the phone delivered to me was defective. The touch screen was not at all working. First you get a mail from support to download/install some app for troubleshooting. Wonder how can one do it if the phone is not at all working?? Next you have to wait for the call from their technical people who are given the powers to accept/reject your replacement request. The worst part is if you happen to miss the call due to any reason, its your headache to call support again to schedule the callback. The support guys keep on asking to do some useless things which is difficult for a new person (new to technology) to do fearing he/she may damage the device in the process. I had to call in support 4 times in 4-5 days before my replacement was accepted. Think of the pain one goes through especially after paying the full amount for a defective piece. The worst part about this purchase was that I had gifted it to somebody. The real test for anything is in times of trouble. My first experience with the flip kart support had been terrible. My perception about flipkart has changed and I will think 100 times before placing an order again (if I decide to ever)",

From the 2nd day of delivery its software was giving me problem. its display goes blank automatically. Flipkart's smartapp check was unable to find the problem and so they rejected my return request every time. They wasted my 1 month like this and then said that return policy is over so go to the service center where it was told to me that there was a bug in the software so they updated it. It worked well for 2 days and now again the same problem. Flipkart is neither replacing the cell not refunding my money and i m still with a moto g2 toy. At least toy works.

This handset has a serious defect with microphone.. Moto G(2nd Gen) is a poor quality product both hardware wise and software wise.. screen not enough touch sensitive and we need to be press screen to select option - so it is a press screen not touch screen.. it has many other problems I cannot list on flipkart.. in one line I suggest others not to go for this faulty product from motorola - but flipkart as usual is good at its work.. giving 1 star only for Flipkart service and no stars for Motorola's Moto G(2nd Gen)..

These highly helpful team of \"professionals\" at the centre told me that the product was liked by millions and I was a fool to think otherwise, i shouted and fought for my right and was told that that's the best they provide and the problem is figment of my imagination. Head Down I returned and am stuck with this phone. Moral: Please don't fall for the hype. never ever buy this pathetic product",

No doubt this phone stands as one of the best phones under 15k range. As far as phone for best selfies is concerned, well, Xperia C3 steals the show :) Also xperia c3 has better battery back up when compared to moto g2.",

Story Begins: Got Moto X, fell down from cot, glass broke, cost of replacement a whooping 13,000. Bull Shit, throwed away. Dillema Begins: Confused between Apple, Motorola and Microsoft Lumia. Went to Apple Store and Reliance Store in Orion Mall, gone through all the mobiles from iPhone 6 to iPhone 4s, even though it was not under my budget. Went to Orion mall, wasted my car parking fees. This went on for 3 days. Finally decided to order Moto G 2nd Gen. Ordered from Flipkart on May 2nd, 11:00, (2 mobiles Moto G 2nd Gen and Moto E for same day delivery). Delivered on same day around 17:30. Found out dead pixel, requested for replacement. Got a call from flipkart on Sunday around 3 PM and finally replaced the phone the very next day itself. Hmmmmmmmm, now I am enjoying, chatting with my Friends. Phone review will be update shortly.",

I immediately tried to file a return but the 'return product' link is gone! I sent a mail to Flipkart and two days after that (31st day) I was told since 30 days are gone they won't replace it and that I should go visit a service center. Way to go, FK!

The phone had fallen from about one foot and that too on a thin cotton carpet and the screen broke. I thought this is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display. When I took it to the service center they asked for Rs 6500/- for the change of display since the screen breaking is not covered in the warranty. That is fine but the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen breaking with one foot fall and that too on a carpet is not understood. It just means they are just claiming it to be Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to fool the crowd since there is no method of checking the same for the buyers. I have another phone from Moto in the family ie. a Moto E which didn't even fall and there is a very minor crack in the screen. This phone was with my wife who is very careful with her items but the screen cracked automatically. I thought the cell phone was cheap but now I have landed up paying Rs 19500/- total and at this rate could;d have got much better phone. I feel cheated. Ashok",

The performance was acceptable and all was well for 45 days. A chance drop of the phone from my shirt pocket on Dec 15 shattered the display glass. The phone was working fine and just the 'gorilla' glass was cracked. Easy replacement? No chance. A call to to the Motorola Call Center yielded a 7k Quote for complete display replacement. 7k to replace the glass(as far as I am concerned) on a 13k phone? I have decided to throw the phone and get another one (Not Moto). Why? coz im sure the glass will break the next time the phone drops and I cant afford to be shelling out 7k every other month The kicker is that Motorola offers a free one-time screen replacement for all phones ordered directly from its website. In India, the phone is sold exclusively through flipkart which effectively rules out the screen replacement offer. Talk about step motherly treatment. So here's me saying Hi and Goodbye to the only Moto product I will ever own.",

I have received the item at 1PM on Sep 8 and shot out a mail to Flipkart customer support within an hour describing the defects/issues. The summary of issues I faced: 1) The volume button rocks. I can overlook that. However, the volume down button doesn't work properly. I have to press the volume down button repeatedly to bring up the volume bar 2) 3G and Edge: Neither of the SIM slots on my mobile picks the 3G/Edge connection profile. I have no issue with same SIMs on my other phones. Even when the Edge connection is detected, the signal is lost within 2 minutes. When I pop in the same SIMs in my neighbour's Moto G (Second Gen) they work flawless. 3) LED notification is erratic. I have reviewed the settings at Setting> Display> Pulse Notifcation Light 4) Proximity Sensor doesn't work. I have tried removing the polythene cover to make sure nothing comes in the way of the sensor 5) Wifi: Wifi disconnects repeatedly. The passwords are not stored. Other devices on the same network work without a hitch 6)Screen auto-rotate doesn't work - reviewed settings in Settings > Display> Auto rotate screen 7) MicroSD card not detected properly. It is unmounted frequently 8) Touch is not registered properly. Especially when I use the Chrome browser 9) Charging the device takes a hell a lot of time Troubleshooting steps I tried: 1) Factory reset 2) Switching on the Airplane mode and turning it off (to refresh the network settings) 3) Swap SIMs. Try different SIMs from various service providers 4) Tried MicroSD with various capacities, classes and brands I am put off by Flipkart Customer Support. My mails to them have not elicited any proper response. I have raised the replacement request for the product. I will update the review when I get a replacement. Disclaimer: The above review summarizes the issues I faced with the device. It is not my intention to blame the product. It is unfortunate that I received a lemon. I see most members of the fraternity are having a jolly good time. Having said that, I am thoroughly disappointed with Flipkart's lackadaisical customer support.",

            "comment": "-0.5 star for HIGH SAR VALUE -0.5 star for something that makes feel quality downgrade Initially, I rated 3 stars, now I increased the rating to four stars due to improved battery backup after the lollipop update. The updated review is at end, so please read till end of the review.. Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 , Nexus 7, Spice dream Uno, I have owned Xiaomi Mi3, Galaxy Grand, Xperia ZL, Lumia 525, Canvas 2 colors, Sony LWW n MOTO E.. so I have fair amount of knowledge about these electronic Gadgets and I am a gadgets freak..... THIS REVIEW IS FOR A NEUTRAL PERSON WHO IS CONFUSED FOR WHICH MOBILE TO CHOSE in the midrange segment. PROS: 1) Its Motorola 2) Screen is bright and vivid 3) Best stock android phone under Rs 15000 4) Camera in daylight 5) Nice grip 6) Speakers somewhat CONS: 1) Camera in night 2) Speakers give cracking noise at maximum volume level 3) Requires too much time for charging SCREEN : The screen is pretty nice one.. I like its vividness.. Seriously my Mi3 didn't had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Asus zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it.. No problems with the screen Performance:- CAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a 13k phone, my canvas 2 colors' 8mp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one.. The images appear blurry and lost focused.. The mi3 camera is very good. GAMING:- This is the place where it hits the sweet spot.. It is lil bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3.. You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two.. SPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit.. So they are better than the competition at this price but not the best... And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's stereo speakers.. HTC's speakers are way too superior to those.. Headset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820... (I own a sennheiser , skullcandy titan ,Skullcandy Ink'd 2, Mi ear phones and Creative ep 630 sony MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..) CALL CLARITY AND \"SAR\" VALUE:- The call clarity is good but not excellent.. The best call clarity among the mobiles I used until now is from HTC Desire 820... When I bought the phone, the SAR values mentioned on flipkart website were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page.. And I was UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SAR VALUE ON THE BOX AS WELL AS PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO MENTION THE SAR VALUE ON PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING TO INDIAN REGULATIONS.. I bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola... I feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY. My 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality product. I have owned Mi3 and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone. FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G 2nd gen TO BE ON PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobiles like me, will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise.. It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition. End result: Friends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at YU Yureka or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money.. And lastly, if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G2. UPDATED 20/02/2015: After the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more, or should I say far more... The entire experience after the update is very very good... But as compared to Mi3, its still below par.. But as Mi3 sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone 5, it seems moto g2 is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto g2 is being used by my dad.. Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update... Other than that, the phone is smooth as butter.. Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handler for the lollipop update.. So overall, I will strongly recomment others to go with moto g2 ( after lollipop update only) if they are looking for proper balance of performance, design and software.. I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire... Thank You for reading this.. Will update soon as per the experiences..",

Fake Offers & Demands --------------------------------- I bought 2 nos Moto G 2nd gen on very launch date 6th Sep 2014, 12.05 AM. The prices of covers and cases looks funny (you declared the customers as fools). I am provided with 50% off on cases & covers. Till now I didnt receive any sign of availing the offer. Called plenty of times with customer care and sent plenty of emails and got some irrelevance or improper response. Do you want the customers to wait more than 10 days and run behind you to avail the offer? Plenty of fraudulent things under Terms and condition. Saddest thing is it is not visible anywhere when you place the order. I promise this would be my last order in flipkart. If you guys keep on treat customers like idiots, soon you will lose them.",

This handset from the time of launch is still readily available on flipkart :) I liked the handset look, feel and overall aspects. The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones. The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours. Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday.",

I bought this phone on October I did face a lot of issues and got replaced three times and the replaced mobile had more issues than the first mobile. 1st Mobile: WORKED PERFECTLY, no hardware or software issues except for battery, which drained in less than 3hrs. So requested a replacement. 2nd Mobile: Camera issue, Flash issue, Touch stuttering issue, Network drop issue, 3G connectivity issue. Requested replacement. 3rd Mobile: Combine all the above issues, I thought to live with that and suddenly one day the phone crashed while using camera and rebooted. Guess what? the phone got stuck in \"boot loop\"(Google It), I call it LIMBO. 4th time: Got refunded. It took me a whole day explaining the \"Flipkart Tech Support\". Some how those people understood my distress call and refunded the money.(You guys know how support works right. pathetic!!!) Here is my findings and a word of caution to all fellow on-line shoppers *The phone is great for the price, if you are lucky to get a good one.(Some of my friends bought this phone during the initial sales and they never faced any issues) *Once replaced you wont get a new phone but a refurbished phone.(APPLIES TO ALL PRODUCTS IN FLIPKART) *I found that the product went out of stock a week back and it is back in stock now, PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, not all are new phones sold right now in the current lot, many are refurbished model.(Verified from a trusted source) I am a Sony fanboy, I just wanted to experience the stock android interface. Since Moto G2 offered a good specification at lower price with near stock android I bought this phone. The phone is amazing if you get a good one. From my experience I am never going to buy a cheap phone ever ever ever in my life. Heading to Sony Smartphone Lounge......",

My friend have ASUS Zen Phone 5 and i compared all aspects and my reaction is just amazing because in many aspects it beat the Asus like in Camera quality (front specially its front camera is exceptional even my friend's galaxy s5 can't beat it),build quality,look wise ,call quality ,gps, multitasking ,the display of the phone is far better than asus although both have 294 pixel but color contrast and brightness in my moto g is far better (he also amaze when we test it).and Last what i Love the most is its dual STEREO SPEAKERS which is at the front produce a clear sound . Its sound quality is exceptional . That's all .Frankly go for the moto g 2 for after sale services also and you got the Kitkat 4.4.4 in it and in Nvember when Android L will come in market you would be the first to get it . Thanks for reading.....",

Coming to the delivery, flipkart does a very decent job they delivered the phone on the next day. Camera: Does a decent job in indoor and outdoor. Voice quality is very good. But i'm worried about only the signal catching. my Samsung and iphone is showing up good signal strength. Found one issue after the factory default reset. the keyboard is not working as expected. but after a reboot everything works perfect. The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything. so im using another wall charger.",

The phone had fallen from about one foot and that too on a thin cotton carpet and the screen broke. I thought this is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display. When I took it to the service center they asked for Rs 6500/- for the change of display since the screen breaking is not covered in the warranty. That is fine but the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen breaking with one foot fall and that too on a carpet is not understood. It just means they are just claiming it to be Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to fool the crowd since there is no method of checking the same for the buyers. I have another phone from Moto in the family ie. a Moto E which didn't even fall and there is a very minor crack in the screen. This phone was with my wife who is very careful with her items but the screen cracked automatically. I thought the cell phone was cheap but now I have landed up paying Rs 19500/- total and at this rate could;d have got much better phone. I feel cheated. Ashok",

The cover is not good and will make your screen look bad and touch feel bad. + The battery might take 4-5 days to get adjusted, so please wait for 4-5 days and then use and comment on battery life. + Those who are new to android , please install an app named file explorer (fx icon) from google play to access internal memory and sd card. Also, you will need it to send mp3 and other files. Also, you can set your own ringtone by moving files to ringtone folder using fx. +Join fb group named Motorola Moto G (2nd Gen) for more queries. Review: + Heats very rarely in normal use + Nice build quality + Pure Android (4.4.4) with google now launcher, no lag observed till now. (ALSO GUARANTEED UPGRADE TO ANDROID LOLLIPOP 5.0) + Display quite good (but not as good as old moto g) + Front cam much better than old moto g, Rear cam is also better. + Battery Life: around 24hrs with mixed usage. + Sound is loud and clear (for getting good quality sound from speakers, you have to follow few steps which are available on the fb group, after fb . com, just put /groups/motogxt1068/ and join) - RAM consumption by Motorola services is more than old moto g, so a bit less free RAM available. Sometimes, during multitasking apps get killed in background due to this. - Back covers are costly Thanks to flipkart, delivered in a day in Pune, even if I didn't use in a day delivery!",

            "comment": "First of all I want to say please do not crib about the hardware and the price.do not compare it with chinese phones.When Branded Companies like Samsung,Sony,Lg sell their devices with the same hardware and poor screen quality at a higher price than the Moto G then no one has a issue.But when a Chinese company sells a phone with the same hardware then everyone says Motorola is overpriced.Remember people it was the Moto G that shook the mid tier segment. Now lets talk about the device and Flipkart. as usual bang on time in a day delivery by flipkart.phone box was well packed.No issues regarding flipkart service. Been using this phone for almost a day now. Pros- Build quality of the phone is fantastic. Superb sound from the front dual speakers. Camera-Motorola has really worked on the camera.the picture clarity has improved by a huge margin.the 8mp camera is way better than the 5mp camera of the Moto G.even the front camera is now better.So full marks to Motorola for improving the camera. Screen Quality-its a 5 inch 720 IPS LCD screen and as usual the quality of the display panel is very good,viewing angles are good too.color reproduction is also very natural and not over saturated. Stock Android experience-The phone is running the latest version of Android.i.e.4.4.4.Kitkat.apart from the 2-3 Motorola apps,there is no bloatware.that's the main reason Motorola did not bump up the processor and the Ram.as the hardware can easily work,multi tasking is also smooth on the phone.no lags. gaming experience is also fun now because of the front dual speakers. Micro SD expansion upto 32gb another feather added in the cap. cons- Motorola could have bumped up the battery capacity upto 2300mah. The phone could be a bit more sleek. Overall i would say this phone is here to stay inspite of the stiff competition. thank you motorola and flipkart for releasing this phone in India so soon. one small request-please get the Moto 360 watch to India ASAP!!!",

First off, the charger is a major improvement than what was being shipped with the moto g so kudos on that. (For the unaware the moto g had a three pin euro style charger, the current one is a standard two pin) It comes fitted with a screen guard, and includes your headphones. The display is beautiful and flawless, and invokes jealousy. You might just lose a few friends over it. The sound quality: loud and clear. The front speakers are a major plus. My neighbors will tell you of that. The wifi connectivity is sound. One thing that is not mentioned in the description is the moto assist, which is spot on the best pre-loaded thing in the phone. Google maps ensure you do not get lost in your backyard and the camera ensures you can tell your friends over whatsapp if you do get lost. The matt finish on the back cover makes you want to hold it all day long. Well at least i did. the buttons are a bit tight, but i guess it will get better over time. So should you buy it?. Yay! Well yes, unless you came here on a pre-historic animal you will buy it. Well maybe you would buy it more then, but whatever. Honestly i would sell myself for such a phone. But the best part HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICE? I do not have to. As is customary: Flipkart is awesome. the phone was delivered in 26 hours of release. Though honestly i intended to study. Thanks to Flipkart's epic delivery i am now failing. Way to go Flipkart. Yay! Buy it!",

Was completely satisfied for first two months. As i starting clicking more pictures and loading more songs the phone started to become slow, slower day by day and two days back it kept restarting for sometime and then refused to turn on. I still have no luck with it. The phone just wont turn on. I called up the Flipkart customer care and was told that only for the 1st month they are responsible and after that any issue that occurs would be handled by the Motorola service center. I am yet to take my phone there. I dint expect a 13k worth phone to work for 3 months and stop and refuse to even start. This was a big disappointment for me, i have bought several things online but i guess buying electronics online is a bad decision, atleast for me. The phone is really good look wise and for the price, i feel the camera did a fab job too, no complaints about the audio part as well. But all this for 3 months only? Thats my concern here. I was so satisfied with the phone the 2nd month that i was on the verge of buying another moto G 2nd Gen for gifting my husband, glad i dint do it.",

Even though it was general holiday i had requested the Flipkart executive Pushpa and since had given 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery (what ever you say, which cannot be trusted) on 25th and she also mentioned that she is personally following up with the order and make sure that it will be delivered on 25th itself since it was Christmas Gift. Nobody bothered to get in touch with me on the status of the order, i myself contacted the and i spoke 4-5 times with all different executives and they all said the same. I waited till 9PM since it was told by your executive that it will be delivered before that time. But my phone was delivered on 25th as promised by all of your Flipkart executives which i had blindly trusted.whatever promise i had made was fulfilled because i trusted you guys. even though i had payed the amount for one day delivery the order was not delivered in one day. And all of executives made false promises which you failed to delivery. Do you guys understand how much pain i had to go because of guys and do you guys understand 100% assurance or 100% guaranteed delivery meaning or do you guys know to maintain a promise or just pretend to delivery. I made a big mistake in trusting you and trusting your executives promises. This is last transaction with Flipkart and will never come back to you guys and also i will never refer your guys to anyone.",

About Phone: This Phone comes with 5 inch IPS display with Gorilla glass on top of that. Screen resolutions is perfect and you will feel good when you see it. It is almost like Moto g but bigger screen so that makes even more cool. I have been using this Phone without removing the screen cover motorola provide. (I will remove it soon and write about touch sensitivity in my next post). Dual Front speakers are extra ordinary and with audio settings, it is as perfect as it gets. Loud, Clear sound you can hear. Processor is same as Moto G, so if you have used moto g before then u can skip to next point. Processor is smooth and dint lag a bit till now. I have used browser to test and doing other tasks like running other apps. all is working smooth. About camera, i had a very bad experience in the beginning. I taken some pictures without flash it was working fine and i turned on flash from auto, camera was not responding. i had to re boot the phone again. After sometime, i tried taking pics with flash on and it worked (IDK how). I have reported this motorola india. Hopefully they will come up with some update. I have made a few phone calls, noise cancelling is excellent. You can hear other person's voice crystal clear. This is excellent for all. It has Micro SD card so that is advantage with google gives you option of back ups, so you never run out of memory i feel. About battery i have got decent battery juice without charging much. Again advance part of battery in Next post. that's all folks for now. Next post will definitely contains all Pros and Cons of the phone.

It is like I am just using a normal phone and not a smartphone. Flipkart - I want the phone replaced asap.",

And the most useful upgrade u can add an Sd Card Cons: 1 . I don't know if my piece is defected or it is manufacturing defect after some usage burning or plasticky smell comes from Head Phone Jack 2 . the battery backup is low and not great as previous Moto G 3 . and the charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone. 4 . There is no upgrade in processor or its clock speed or in RAM Hope this will help u Guys and surely it is a good product to buy.",

I bought a white one and it looks stunning and the phone has good finish.I have used my friends old Moto G which was much better than my samsung Y duos and the new Moto G feels amazing with its upgrades. But the 2nd gen Moto G isn't that good when we compare the screen resolution and picture clarity, with the old one. . Another major concern is the battery. Moto G with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 mah, which was the one of the drawbacks of the phone. Atleast now they should have used 2500 mah battery for the 5inch new moto G, but they have used the same 2070 mah battery. So I should spend another 1000-1500Rs on a power bank. The company should have focused on the internal specs, but the budget remains the same as in the old moto G-Rs12999. So this has overshadowed all the minor cons. Asus zenfone 5, Xiaomi Mi3...... may look better than Moto G with its advanced specs but the chinese mobiles wont last long. Also I dont want to buy a chinese product and boost their economy and most importantly, I read in an article that the Xiaomi mobiles aren't secured. So in the end Moto G is the best pick in the under 15K category even with its limited specs.",

Flipkart will wash their hands if it is ever a one sec over 30 days, Motorola's award winning (read pathetic and abysmal) service will make a mockery of your complaint and you will have to wait until eternity to only hear that your damn devise will only be repaired or replaced through one of the used and discarded parts of the other unused devises. Motorola's service sucks and they will care not shit about your complaint. They don't ever have a full fledged customer care system. Its only a number advertised which if you call, they will place you on hold, only to never come back and then you will disconnect crying. They will make you call again and again and then finally give you a badly repaired phone which also, has no gaurantee, will work or not. I have bought Motorola once and resolve to not but it ever in my lifetime again. A general word of advise for my friends reading - there are many options in the market - never go for Motorola products. I have another smartphone iPhone 4s and Apple has excellent service - they will replace the phone, in case it has any defects (during the warranty period), no questions asked - that's what you call customer satisfaction. Motorola will make you cry and suffer but will never meet your satisfaction. They are only interested to make a sale, not to win customers. Shun Motorola - Will never buy their products again. Pathetic service.",

I would give a review on the following points Display-Fairly good and no distortion in pixels observed even when the phone is held up close to the eye.it is also water resistant and with gorilla glass 3 no effect of scratches or drops i dropped it twice accidently bt nthng happened :) Battery backup-fairly good although it would last longer as the android l update would add juice to it.could have been better though. Multitasking-Good, can open a lot of apps on background although some heavy duty apps like asphalt 8 were observed to crash or restart which are common though.frankly I have not found a phone with zero app crashes. dont know if 2gb ram would have been better. Memory-This is where it kills everybody 16gb of storage with expandable storage of 32gb and an otg feature is a super memory u can carry around anywhere. Camera-shoots good photos,hdr, panorama, has a timer as well shoots 720p videos and slow motion videos as well and not 1080p as some other ppl mentioned. Software-pretty much stock android with no file explorer but u can always install third party apps which work seamlessly and the most important feature is that it will receive android l update any time soon which is a great feature as it comes with enhanced battery power and material design.plays 720p videos normally and can play 1080p with help of apps like mx player Sound-headphones are bad go for other headphones which give superior sound performance on the phone like sony or sennheiser i bought the later and sound quality on the motog2 dual stereo speakers is also loud so u can easily watch videos listen to songs and set loud alarms in the morning :) Overall-good phone good price established brand name go for it.",

They telling motherboard broken and they asking Rs.8000 for repair which is not comes under my warranty. That phone don't have any physical damage at all I din use that phone also but suddenly that mobile goes dead. That service person telling u want to pay for it . Even I spoke to Motorola customer care they telling u should pay. So am helpless not even 2 months passed. My mobile is dead. I brought it from flipkart on 5/10/2014 and On 29/12/2014 my mobile is dead. Worst products from Motorola don't even buy it. For this we can buy at least micromax. I will give 0 rating only",

The battery life is a whole another story. After a full 100% recharge, the phone battery keeps draining itself. The battery just lasts for 3-5 hours top using net,social media apps and music. I had to sign out of all social media apps and switch off the net to save battery but then what is the use of a smart phone. It's very frustrating. Also the charger heats up a lot during charging. People have written reviews saying that their phone battery has lasted up to a whole day if not more using everything. Is my phone faulty. The phone is really good for its price and i would like to have it. Is a replacement possible?? Please get back to me ASAP",

Sometimes I'm unable to drag the notification bar down or sometimes Chrome won't register any clicks but is able to scroll pages up and down. Tapping on the URL box won't open it up. Reboot seems the only solution to these issues. I've asked for a replacement piece. Lets see how the new phone performs. Update (12th September): After calling up flipkart every day for the last 3-4 days and listening to their standard response (we'll give you a callback within 24hrs or the end of the day), I finally got a call from their customer support team, asking me to remove the screen protector and also do a hard reset of the phone by holding the volume down and power key while the phone was powered down. That did get me to the bootloader screen, but I had to read other tutorials on the internet to wipe the data and cache partition from the recovery screen. After the phone enters the Recovery screen, you would need to hold the Volume up key for 10-15 seconds and then tap and release the power key. That'll bring up the wipe menu. Anyways, I did all that, and the phone worked perfectly for about half an hour, until I went to the PlayStore App to download Whatsapp, and I couldn't click on the 'Install' button. Tapping it would instead bring up the screenshots beneath the button. Then I tested pulling the notification bar down and lo and behold, it didn't work and was stuck. Tried locking the screen and unlocking, but that didn't solve the issue. It was still stuck and also I couldn't tap on the URL box on Chrome, so clearly it wasn't registering my taps like the way it should. Then called up Flipkart CC, recounted my woes again for almost the 6th time, and they finally agreed for a replacement, which is suppose to reach me by 9PM tomorrow. Had they been active and had themselves given me a call and offered a replacement, I wouldn't have had to call them multiple times. Now I can't figure out who I'm more disappointed with - Flipkart (for their crappy customer service) or Motorola (for their crappy phone). I'll wait for the replacement and see if that performs without any flaws. Not much hope left, as mostly all 1star reviews here are about touch issues. Will update my review accordingly.",

After receiving the product, when i started using the handset, i immediately started noticing issues with the handset. After only few hours of usage i realized the following problems -: 1. I could not hear the receiver's/caller's voice whenever I made/received a phone call. 2. Then suddenly the display went off. After that, every time i locked the screen, display would go completely off. 3. When I tried restarting the phone it would get extreme hot. I put a request for return(return id 20964090) with flipkart. But dealing with the Customer Support has only been a hassle. I received an email saying your technical expert would contact me at a certain specified time. However I did not receive any form of communication from flipkart. It was only after i wrote an email to customer support that i got a reply saying that again your technical support would contact me at a specified time. However, i still didn't receive any call from your team. After this, I called Flipkart's Customer Service department and the service employee was anything but patient with me. He was rude and had no interest in listening to my complaint. He said me that I would receive a call from your technical expert within 24 hours. However, within a few hours I received an email saying that the seller has disapproved my return request. How can the seller disapprove my return request without any explanation ? Your technical expert never contacted me, so how did the seller know what's wrong with my device. Do they just cancel a return request without even analyzing or looking at the device ? After all this, I have to say that my experience with Flipkart has only been abysmal. When you claim to be such a well established and respected e-commerce business, its about time you start acting like one. Congratulations !!! , you've managed to disappoint a loyal customer and lost him forever. Again, I request you take a look at this and take necessary steps to handle customer grievances more efficiently. Let me be very clear that I would not hesitate to take this matter to the concerned authorities, if need be.",

Customer care executive advise me to contact nearest Service center i,e \u201cSMART SERVICES\u201d ,which is at Bhubaneswar. I have contacted the service center on 22nd April\u201915 .They checked and told me that \u201cPCB was damaged and need replacement and reqd minimum 15 days. On 7th of May\u201915 ,when I was called around 11 AM,they told me that the Phone is OK and I have reached the service center around 12.15 PM and they keep me telling several times that wait for 15 mins and same dialogue they keep telling me till 3.30 PM and this is really surprise for me. When service center confirm me that the hand set is ready, I thought that they are ready with all means. During delivery, I was pointed one problem, that SIM -1 is not working (problem was not exist before PCB Change) and very frequently SIM-1 signal is coming and going, but SIM-2 is perfectly OK. They told me that, it will be ok, may be some signal issue. I was in hurry, because I have some important meeting without solving the problem and I signed the invoice copy. Today (9th May\u201915) ,I reached the service center (SMART SERVICES) again for SIM-1 signaling problem. Again they have checked, told that, now it is OK. But, when I was came out from service center after 10 mins the same problem is showing. Today, I have also shown another problem to service center team, some blue spot in the screen. They told me that, wait for few days, then they will chk again. I am really surprise about the service provided by authorized service center of renowned International company \u201cMotorola\u201d. I am really disappointed with the service and phone performance. I have already regd one complain and send to Motorola help desk ,but after three days nobody called me. I am expecting Flipkart should change my handset,otherwise there reputation will deteriorate with this type exp.",

If I use it only for wi-fi then it takes 2.5 hrs to drain battery. Another problem is the charger...it takes 3.5-4 hrs to charge the battery. once the battery is at 30-25% then need to charge it other wise it takes very long time to charge. I don't expect this from a Moto (google) phone. Hope everyone is facing the same issue. Other than the battery issue overall phone is nice.",

After 2 weeks of usage, I am seeing hairline scratches.Better to have screen guard or flip cover. 2. Average battery life. That's usual with android OS which has mediocre power management. On Normal usage ( 1 hr phone call, 45 mins songs, facebook, mail check) back up provided is 36 hrs. Have seen people complaining about battery backup. one sugggestion is to try apps like \"Battery doctor\" to optimize battery usage. There are lot of unwanted process which will be running that drains battery so fast. 3. Charger provided is below standard.. its heating up itself and the phone while charging, so I stopped using that. When it comes to ear-bud, it's not worth talking about. 4. Sometimes, camera flash light stays on even after closing camera app (am talking about graceful exit). Have noticed this issue only once. Then ,restarted the phone, flash light stayed for few seconds after reboot, then turned off. 5.Screen picks up finger impression and dust.. its horrible.. 6.While listening music, if u receive a call, after attending and hanging up the call, the songs resume with low volume. when u check volume status , volume bar shows full !!!!. expected behaviour is to resume the songs with previous known volum lelvel. Moving to next track resumes to last known volume %.... ugly software. But there are lot of +ve about this phone which other reviewers pointed out. Somehow, I feel this phone is very delicate.. Need to handle with care..",

I was using Samsung Quattro before this, and Moto G felt a lot lighter in hand. The display is great in sunlight also, I did not have to adjust the brightness in my car. Samsung almost gone black in daylight. Regarding the screensize, the full screen view is available only on youtube video and Kindle book reading mode, as far I get to check. So the extra screen size is not usable in normal usage. As Samsung has hardware buttons which are extra to screen, so the actual display area is same as in 4.7 inch screen on Samsung or other hardware button android devices. The camera is great. The front and back camera is giving satisfactory pictures in low light also. Battery is average, you will need to charge once a day at normal usage. Memory it has almost 12GB for user storage. The RAM it is showing only 300 MB FREE and in total only 850MB. Do not know where that 150MB went. Overall a great device at this price, buy it if you want the best Android phone in 13000.",

The battery did not withstand even when it was idle (No 2G or 3G usage). Just the mobile was used for phone call purpose. It will take very long hours to charge and the charge will get dry very soon. After one week of the purchase, I raised complaint to FlipKart guys. Here is the service procedure if your raise complaint: The service was very PATHETIC. Their automated process will send one time schedule to call for the troubleshooting. In case accidentally if you miss that call again you have to wait 24 hours. But, in case they didn't call they will again schedule another callback after 24hours. The call time will never be your choice and they will try to drag the days(every 24hours) so that the ticket will expire. The ticket will be resolved without your knowledge and they will ask you to raise new ticket so that again the process will start from scratch. By writing emails to customer care they will never worry or care. In spite of follows up one fine day we gave up and accepted to live with that faulty mobile. At the end, Flipkart motive is achieved. If you get a phone with no issues, they really you are lucky. In case if you get a faulty one then that's it. Never expect a good replacement and a quality of service from them.",

The power button is half pressed so u dont have to press harder and works only 50% of the time. Very good for thumb muscles. 2: The battery life is awesome. My best performance was 6 hours. It was jaw dropping. Plus the battery gets headed when charged. Awesome for those cold and chilly nights. 3: The resolution is crisp like a wet 'papad'. A little twist and i can literally count the pixels. Forget abt using the phone at a slant angle. 4: 10 mins of playing the Game and Its hot enough for a f**king omlet. Saves Gas i guess... Plus when asked for a replacement, i was asked to install a app and was asked to replicate every problem during that call. How am i gonna show my pixelated screen and non functional button to a person on call?? Lastly i gave up and politely asked her to cancel the request. I guess time to move on to Amazon or Snapdeal.

            "comment": "HELLO EVERYONE.. Well Folks, I'm not here to tell you all the specs of the phone or something like that...Everybody knows about the 5 inch screen, Stereo speakers, RAM, camera etc etc... What I want to share is the real experience of the phone. There are quite a lot of myths about the device and I might be able to help the confused lot..! 1. First of all..Many people think that this phone has the same back cover problem which was there in the Moto E, because the design process is the same on the two. Well, that is not the case. The back cover fits perfectly..so no issues with that.. :) 2. People also do think that the BATTERY backup is not as good as the original Moto G. Well, yes up to some extent it IS true, considering the 5 inch display and the same size battery but its not horrific..It still lasts for about a day with mixed usage (like casual gaming, music for an hour or 2 and some surfing). Note that if you are a really heavy user..it would last up to 4.5-5 hours (with Wi-fi, mobile data of course and movies, heavy gaming etc) 3. The STEREO SPEAKERS...yes those are true stereo speakers! We do have a Left channel and a Right channel, but they are by no means GREAT speakers...there is a bit of distortion, specially at loud volumes. Its good for gaming, Youtube videos, movies etc..but when it comes to pure music...the Pro's would not be that happy with it..Although, for average users like me, it is a nice experience. 4. GAMERS..!! This point is for you.. Well, this device certainly can play almost any game in the Playstore without any issues.. BUT it would be nice if you set game graphics to medium. Like for example Asphalt 8..it runs much better when you set the game on Medium settings of graphics. No issues otherwise.. 5. CAMERA...Well , yes I mentioned earlier that I am not going to talk about specs..but I cant help.. The front camera (2 megapixel) is exceptionally good..believe me..It does a lot better than front cameras of other phones..and surprisingly the rear camera too performs better than expected. Moreover, in low lighting it does even better than Moto X..yes that;s true..Picture colours, saturation and low lighting images better than Moto X..! All other factors like Call quality, Signal strengths, connectivity, everything is upto the mark..No need to mention that. Well, all things considered..the performance of this phone is exceptional for this price bracket. This phone is for everyone..Gamers, music lovers(not the pro's), office workers..whoever you are..it piece of beauty is all you need..!! Cheers..! :)",

Pros of Moto G2 its camera is perfect.. good images can be taken in light.. hdr support is best.. flash helps greatly in low light.. games can be played smoothly thanx to its snapdragon quad core processor but u vl notice 1 or 2 lags in high graphics games.. storage of d phone is just vast.. vaaaaaaast... 16gb uuuhooo.. n support or sd card is a bonus.. screen size is perfect.. body of the phone is good.. makes u feel that u r holding a branded phone.. but if u vl see d back shell.. its lyk a garbage.. moto e back shell is far far better than moto g2.. those people who r refering my review to purchase this phn..

Seriously are these guys wantedly extending the delivery time because i didn't opt for next day delivery?. Build Quality : This phone has a great build quality. Even though its back cover is removable you can mistake it for an unibody design. It feels very good to hold the phone and the smooth rubbery back is awesome. Its does not provide a great grip at the same time its not slippery. Display : Its really a big phone. This is the 1st time am using a 720p phone and for my eyes the display looks crisp and clear. I don't speak about viewing angles and all. Duh there is only one view in which you are going to use your phone :P. Outdoor visibility will definitely take a blow. There is no pixellation and all. Reaching the top of the screen is fairly easy thanks to the dimple on the back and the back cover material. Apply android L wallpaper on your phone and you are going to see a nexus 5 in your hand :). Speakers : Nothing much to say here. These are just speakers which are in front and thats all. You can be free of worries that you are not going to miss any calls even if the phone lies over a pillow or a bed. Ringtone, alarm and audio in games are fairly loud. But while playing music it is not that impressive. I tried with different music players but the volume is less only. But i don't use speakers to hear songs as i have a good pair of ear phones. Audio quality from ear phones is flawless. Battery life : From the time jelly bean came out battery life in android is a huge miss only and that continues still now. I read somewhere that a good smartphone should last for about 12 hours and if that is the case then this is a good smartphone. Don't expect anything more. And yeah just like others say it takes more time to charge the phone. From 20% it took a solid 2 hours to reach 80%. Performance : Mark this up. Even after 2 years you will get the same silky smooth performance in this phone. Every thing is buttery smooth and lag free. You can check gaming reviews in youtube to get some idea. Camera : Generally i don't use the camera that much so it won't to be fair for me to speak about the camera. Good to know my phone has an 8MP shooter :D. Things that impressed me : 1. Build quality 2. Stock android experience 3. Call clarity(quality) 4. The price i paid for this experience Things that made me worry : Apart from that network issue nothing else is there for me. Am happy with my phone. Updates(After 3 days of usage) : The network drop issue what i had mentioned earlier is solely my bad. The guy who had cut my sim did not insert it properly. It is a click to insert and remove mechanism. After inserting the sim fully till i got the click i did not face any issue with calls. Outdoor visibility is fair. If you get any calls or receive a text you will be able to clearly see and read the content. You can even reply without any issues. But reading a full length article is a big no no. I had mentioned that volume from the speakers while playing songs was low. I tried 3 players Rocket, Poweramp and Google Play Music. Out of these 3 poweramp gives the same loud experience you get during calls or when your alarm is ringing. You can enjoy the speaker quality with poweramp. Try to use fusion player also and check.",

            "comment": "I was already a fan of MOTO G since last year, the only reason for not picking was lack of expandable memory.. With this 2nd Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone! With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around :) Camera is awesome even for dim lights, good battery, very smooth in operation due to 1gb RAM and quad core processor, excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy! There are already huge praises all over the website, I would just mention one thing, ppl please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money.. I don't understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phones look alike!! and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobiles! Motorola Powered by Google is the BEST combination anytime with unbelievable price.. I was not expecting 2nd gen to be this low at price! Hats off!! Also, If you have been delivered a defected piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Xperia Z1 was replaced by me 2 months back, that doesn't mean its a bad phone! Its just an electronic device, there are chances of manufacturing faults, check properly when you get, use it extensively for a week, analyze it and get it replaced!! Just close your eyes and buy it.. you will love it!!",

Now coming to Moto g . 1. 5 inch HD 720p Display which is just awsome . and you cannot see any pixelation while using the phone. 2. Dual Stereo Speakers - which is fairly loud and quality of sound is very good. you will definitely love to watch movies on Moto G. 3. SD card slot - Although you get around 12-13GB internal storage. But also you can increase your Memory by inserting the micro SD card. ***Also You can Move Apps to SD CARD*** 4. Camera - The 8MP camera is Fairly good. 5. Battery Life is also very good - I played Modern Combat for around 1 hour and the percentage drop was just 6%. This phone is just Amazing Please buy if you want a premium phone at affordable price. Also There is Guranteed update to Android L .",

            "comment": "First of all : I am reviewing a replacement device and Flipkart did a good job on delivering both. Pros : 1. 5\" Screen offers a great viewing experience, colors are bright and brightness is very good. 2. The dual front speakers are not very loud but get's the job done very well. 3. Micro SD is a nice add on atleast in the Indian market. 4. The latest and the greatest android, also the promise to get the fastest update. 5. Price : A thousand buck less than its predecessor , Motorola nailed it. 6. Availability : Unlike some of the other affordable offerings Motorola has been great in availability. A device is great when you can actually buy it. 7. Build Quality is in similar lines with the previous generation, which by every means is great. Cons : 1. WIFI Issues : The fact that wifi is latest here, is great but there is a catch. It happens it does not support some access points/router authentication types which generally other devices does. This was why I replaced it in the first place. But in the replacement device the problems were same, then I did some digging, the fact it is 802.11 b/g/n/ac compatible but the authentication type it is compatible is very limited, i.e. WEP(bit encryption m not sure), WPA/WPA2 (this worked for me). and 802.1X Radius. That's it. If your router has some other it will not detect it even. 2. Size : This may not be a problem for some but yes this thing has grown up huge since its predecessor. 3. Battery : 2070 mah used to power 4.5, same is used to power 5.0 , the math is simple here, with not a good outcome. 4. Buttons : This time buttons have a soft touch feel to it. I am not sure about how it feels but the response of the click is certainly not tactile as it had previously. Overall, Cons other than wifi issues should not have been here considering what we get and what we pay. Recommended : 8/10",

I played something from gaana.com and it almost felt like the song is playing from my laptop :) Display is good and touch screen works really well. Swipes are smooth and app launches are fast. It has 8 MP primary and 2 PM secondary camera and am fairly happy with the cameras, however nothing exceptional about the photos. I believe with 8MP, my samsung S3 took better pics. Don't think much and go ahead to get a premium type phone in budget price.",

Battery drains out very fast (lasted for about 5hr 20 min for extensive usage including wifi, gaming and talking) 3. Phone gets heated up very fast within 45 and can't hold it longer in your hands. 4. The moto g UI is not that great.. Customization has very little options. 5. Camera is ok ok during day. Low light snaps are poor. 6. Headset is of poor quality. 7. Charger doesn't have a usb detachable cable. My experience with the phone is not great. My suggestion would be to think twice before buying.",

            "comment": "Hi, I was thinking of buying a LG G pro2. But my laptop crashed owing to motherboard problem. Next day I see this ad in newspaper about Moto G second generation with bigger 5 inch screen and six vouchers , on launch day with rs 3000 off on laptops and lucky first 100 buyers of moto g to get 100 percent cash back. I pressed the buy button. Moto G arrives next day sharp by 3.00 afternoon from WS retail-a flipkart company (safe to buy from they as they offer 30 day replacement on gadets as against 10 day of other vendors on flipkart and 7 days on snapdeal). The Phone in white with 5 inch screen looked beautiful , even though was packed very simple with no accessory except charger. I did not use phone initially for three days as also have s4 and had another sim which was big and could not fit in moto g. Any how got two sims put in moto g and am using moto g for 3 days now here are observations. PROS : 1.Budget 5 inch hd phone under rs 13000 with good looking white colour compared average s4 samsung black looks 2.Motorola has increased the screen size,and little on battery from 1900 t 2070 mah 3.The phone with 1 gb does not hangs , so far , my s4 with 2gb does hangs and quite smooth to use in that budget compared to other phones in expensive category. 4.DUAL Sim is a big advantage for business class people or who want to use two sims but carry one phone. I do not find many quad core decent brand phones with same dual sim featue in this budget. 5. This moto g set now has expandable memory slot to 32 gb, welcome step. 6.The latest version of android 4.4 on phone will get upgraded to next version immediately. Now the CONS : 1. Motorola has not increased the battery strenth. A meagre 2070 mah is not sufficient to run phone entire day , if you plan to use dual sim, internet on phone, couple of prints from phone directly,whats app, The battery sadly lasts half a day only even when I have not listened to any music or clicked any picture. any 5 inch phone should have at least 2600 mah battery or no point in buying a phone unless you are okay to charge your phone twice a day. It is here where motorola looses out big time for not giving comparable battery for a 5 inch phone. 2. The processor remains the same as on old moto g but though that does not reduces speed to a great length , but avid gamers (I am not a gamer at all) will like faster processors here. 3. The call reception is okay. But sound quality from receiver is not as great as on a samsung set.It is at acceptable or satisfactory level but not great as on my s4. Overall a great buy for dual sim functionality , great looks and functionality at budget but big let down on battery. Hence my three stars",

I thought God finally answered my prayers by intoducing a budget smart phone with all the excellent features i wanted, which no other phone could beat. But then came the dampener, when i looked at the storage feature: Moto g had only 12.9 GB of storage, which will never be enough for my huge music collection. So i was really dissappointed. Last Friday, when the moto g 2nd gen was launched, i was extremely happy! Finally i got my moto g with a memory card slot! This is now one of my most prized posessions! The moto g 2 is really awesome! Some of the Pros and Cons that I found are listed below. Pros: - Big 5\" screen. - Quad core procesor - micro sd card support. - 12.9 GB of internal memory, would be more than enough for all the apps. - 8 MP rear and 2 MP front camera. - Latest Android and guaranteed upgrade to L - Light, handy, rugged and beautiful look, it will be everybody's eye candy! - Gorilla Glass protects the phone from scratches. - flash support and secondary camera - 3G support on both sims Cons: - micro sim (It was difficult to get a micro sim, so I had to take the risk and cut the mini sim in a local mobile store. - Non-removable battery - 1 GB RAM ( moto could have increased it to atleast 1.5 GB) but it does't affect the performance. - Battery backup not so impressive. It gives average battery life. But The Android L OS is expected to increase the battery backup, so keep your fingers crossed! - FM radio not playable through the speakers: I have seen many users complaing that the FM radio cannot be payed on the loud speakers. Here's a solution to play FM radio via speakers: Download the app HF button from the Play store and voila! your problem's solved! Cheers! - Raghav",

            "comment": "Before going to review, let me add this that i am a Moto-G(first generation) user also, so i can clearly distinguish both mobiles. Motorola now came up with brand new Moto-G(2nd generation) mobiles ,keeping all its stack features available and adding few new features that will enhance its market. It looks Moto Market Strategy worked, as it provides high end enhanced features with mid range costs,making mid end & lower end customers to enjoy the high end stuff. Lets go through Pros & Cons. Pros: 1) Increasing in size of screen, but still the make the design as portable within single hand. 2)Front end speakers, i am here to assure that double speakers at front end will provides a A-class audio clarity, that not even we seen in high end mobiles. 3) Rear Camera is of 8 MP and provides descent snaps(Even blurred image is occupying 1.5MB,shows the quality) and front cam is 2MP,which is also worth while. 4) provided with SD card option--Expandable upto 32GB. 5)Performance wise no issue, i had few graphic based games installed and tried to play simultaneously, i didn't find any lags & hangs. 6) Smooth touch & nice display intensity. 7) Few enhanced features in KitKat 4.4.4 itself(find difference in setting wallpaper by on screen and widgets are entirely separated from apps inside menu etc..) And all these enhanced features are taken from Android-L for impatience users. 8) Ensured with Android-L update. 9) Nice battery standby. cons: Here, it is pretty hard to find cons, since manufacturer is providing best as per \"features vs price\" graph. 1) Pixel density is slightly reduced in 2nd generation, but it is hardly observed to naked eye. (first generation users can identify it as they are accustomed to high pixel density). For new Moto customers its like a feast since other mobiles are not even providing 294ppi display(Samsung Grand/Grand 2 runs on 224ppi & HTCexplorer series on 252ppi) . 2) Larger Icons on display i.e no option to change the icon size.(few websites are saying that it is a stack Android-L feature,but not sure). 3) Battery will drain a bit quicker on 3G network. Verdict: High End features to Mid range customers. No lags & hangs moreover Android-L upgrade. Nice camera & descent display. That all a common customer expects and Moto delivered it successfully. Motorola+Google combo is going to rock Indian market again via flipkart.",

If any problem happen with in 30 days of buying then also Flipkart is not giving support . If you will call customer support they will tell you that technical team will give you call after 24 hours and after calling they will only assist you by saying please do factory reset and they close the issue. Even after that also if problem persists they will just start to do time pass by rescheduling the call. I have shown this issue all my colleagues at NIIT Tech. Please do not buy any electronic mobile product at Flipkart -- Regards Amit",

I have exchanged my Moto E 1st gen to buy this phone. Got one faulty product and asked for replacement. After 2 times rejection , they finally agreed to replace my phone ! I woow !! flipkart is so wonderful ! ! This is not the end.. In return the product that I got was 'smart phone ke naam pe dabba' ! It was constantly giving me 6-8 hrs backup ! Raised return request again ! ! Now again faced disappointment from India's no 1 seller ! They checked my phone with 'Smart Check' app (I guess it is created by Rajnikant !! ) and told me my phone is ok and they dont see any issue in it.. in 15 minutes call duration I lost 12 % battery charge ! and they said my phone is fine ! Request rejected ! ! and they suggested me to go to authorize service center to check it up ! Near by to my place I got one. When I reached at Moto authorize service center , they simply said this phone is supposed to give 2-3 hours battery back up when connected to internet !! Again raised request for replacement , probably my 5th replacement request with 20 days of buying my 'new' phone !! This time customer center guys came up with another wonderful test that is supposed to be done by authorize service center guys ! I opposed , and said my phone is in under replacement warranty then why should I go and do this kind of experiment ! wanted to escalate this matter to higher management , so the call center guy said in 4 hours I will be getting a call back.. that date was 25th or 26th of March, today is 15th May ! ! I am still waiting 4 hours to complete ! Dear Flipkart, I don't know you guys will read this or not, but just want to share my concerns with you. You have walked down a long distance to get this position , don't just let it go. You don't have to return my phone. I don't need that anymore .It is a basic courtesy to respond to your customer. Why to keep the request open , give a proper justification and closed that. Definitely I will never buy anymore product from your 'online mega store' ! Thanks for this wonderful disappointing service that I never expected ! ! Finally after I got the call frm FK,,, again same technical gyan n all... suggested me to go back to service center !! I had enuf of torture !! no more.. I politely requested them to cancel this return request , I will live up with my 7-8 hrs backup wala phone.. cant take this kind of discussion anymore ! ! Good bye Flipkart...",

While there are a few pros as I am a first time smartphone buyer, there are more than a few cons, though I have listed only a few. Pros: 1. Excellent Display 2. Good camera - both front and back Cons: 1. Very poor Battery life, even for my limited net usage and video-streaming etc. 2. Very slow processor. This is really painful as even to load contacts or phone mode, it takes ages. It's really, really very slow. I have not downloaded many apps at all but still because of its 1GB RAM, phone is very slow as more than 1/3 is always engaged with system apps (read Google preloaded apps) and another 1/3 with the downloaded apps, even when they are not running. Net result is I have to download Battery Booster and Power booster and keep running them every 1 hour or so. 3. An extension of the previous point - Lot of Google apps are preloaded and keep running in the background and there seems to be no way to shut them down without uninstalling them. and you don't know what would happen to the phone if you uninstall them. 4. Not very user friendly. For eg, you can't change to Silent mode at the touch of a button like in Nokia. Need to get into settings, audio, etc. and then change to Silent or Vibrate etc. 5. For a first time smart phone user, the size is quite big. It becomes difficult to hold the phone and talk for more than 5-10 minutes as it starts paining after sometime. 6. Takes a long time to recharge - more than 3 hours to recharge fully",

You need to carry your powerbank or charge to be on safer side. Upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop is smooth and it gives faster performance than Kitkat. Need to install some apps which are missing in this phone like Voice Recorder and if you like some better call management apps can be used too. A very good purchase if you don't mind it's hungry battery ;) Cheers P.S. I dropped it twice, no damage done.",

For any issue, first they will ask you to come to their service center to examine your device and then ask you to come after arranging for the parts, 2. then you have to leave your device at their service center for 5 days 3. then again you have to go to pick up after paying a big bill. it looks to me their customer care and service centers are paid by their competitors to move people away from Motorola",

So, here is more: performance (responsiveness, speed etc) wise it is not even as good as Moto-e 1st Gen (I used Moto-e before this one) which packs almost half the processing and RAM power compared to its big brother - Moto-G 2nd Gen. Battery is worst! Can't hold up overnight / 9-10 Hrs (on stand by!) with >60% charge left / remaining in the phone. Almost every morning I find phone switched off; else I need to connect it to charger before going to sleep (and wake up mi-night to detach charger!) Pleased by the Moto-e performance (which I bough as a stop-gap / stand by phone until I got my other smartphone repaired) I bought Moto G 2nd Gen with more expectations...only now to be disappointed, disheartened. Big thumbs down to hardware because of bad battery back-up and to software / OS because of all other bad things about the phone.

I decided not to open the box and return the same. Upon replacement request an execute called me and asked me to open and use it. I was not ok fully. Immediately i am getting another SMS that merchant has disapproved the replacement request. I became more suspicious. I again escalated this to Flipkart and they agreed for a replacement.

            "comment": "I was really excited to buy this phone. I ordered one from Flipkart and I got it within three days to my place Kollam via courier. So I give 5 start for delivery and packaging. Now, I'll say what I felt when using this phone, because your experience might be different from this. Motorola says this is an exceptional phone at exceptional price. Let's find out if that is true. But before that, keep all your expectations below Rs. 13,000/- Pros: 1. 5 inch HD (1280 x 720) IPS LCD display with Corning Gorilla glass 3 The display has a ppi of 294 like all 5 inch HD displays do. So you won't notice any pixelation. The Gorilla glass protects the display from scratches caused by normal use. The IPS LCD gives a very good viewing angle. The ambient light sensor detects and adjusts the screen brightness so that it won\u2019t be a problem to use the phone in high lit or low lit conditions. 2. Quality build I don't think Motorola will take any chance to reduce the build quality of their phones to cut down the price and compete with others. So this phone like every other Moto phones is solid and sturdy. You can feel it by just holding it. The phone fits perfect on your hands due to its curvy design of the back. 3. Great 8MP primary camera for stills and 2MP secondary camera. The 8 MP camera let's you to capture any moment with the fine details, be it a well lit or low lit situation. The camera performs very well in low lit conditions. The color gamut is very good too (but a little warm). The HDR is ok. The focus point exposure adjustment is good though it has its limits. Overall the camera is great for stills. The secondary 2 MP camera can satisfy your selfie needs. 4. Front facing stereo speakers. Sound quality of the stereo speakers is good and they are loud enough to enjoy music, games and movies, but don't expect too much. 5. Latest Lollipop flavor. It's Android and nothing is more pleasing than enjoying the latest flavor of it. I got the phone updated with latest Lollipop out of the box. So I didn't have to update it myself, and the software updater says the phone is up to date. 6. Water resistant coating (not waterproof) Motorola says the Moto G2 got water resistant nano-coating to protect the phone from moisture inside out. But that doesn't mean it is waterproof. Water could still enter it. So it's just an additional protection and be careful with your phone near water. Cons: 1. Battery really could have been improved The 2070 mAh is not enough for a 5 inch phone. I still wonder why they didn't increase the battery capacity when they upgraded the previous Moto G. Even the new Moto E 2 has got 2390 mAh capacity. The battery is built-in and non-removable. That's not a problem at all. 2. Needs more RAM You'll get around 500 MB of free RAM after the initial boot without installed any user applications. But things start to change when you start multi-tasking and switch between different apps. It'll get really annoying. Some of the competitors of Moto G2 have more than 1 GB of RAM, for example Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo - 1.5GB, Asus Zenfone 5 - 2GB etc. 3. No Full HD Video Recording Why the hell is that ? That's all I want to ask. But you can still play Full HD videos and movies. 4. Very bad headphone output I have to say this; the 3.5mm jack output really sucks ! You'll need a very sensitive pair of headphones to enjoy any music. That's a shame. 5. No USB Data Cable A charger with removable USB cable would have been handy. Other pros and cons: 1. The power and volume rocker buttons have some play and are hard to press 2. OTG support 3. No file manager application Other competitors in the price range: Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo, HTC Desire 616 Dual Sim, Asus Zenfone 5, Sony Xperia M2 Bottom line : I'd really recommend this phone to others. :)",

First phone received: Noticed a bubble formation on camera lens (there was no plastic cover over the lens). Speakers would crack at high volumes. though the exchange was quick and hassle free. Exchange product received: Looked good. Was starting to get used to the phone when I realised that there is intermittent static disturbance in all calls made. Tried using same sim with other phones, call quality was perfect. So, poor call quality was a very huge let down. Moreover, this new phone with lollipop updated (as given by flipkart) drops wifi signal every 15-20 mins and remembered wifi networks also have to be connected manually as it shows 'authentication problem'. This problem is faced by many after the latest update. Thus, my luck was not so good both the times and now I'm struggling to get a refund and go for another handset as I don't wanna keep trying my luck. Nevertheless, my friends still have the same phone working very smoothly My advice: If you are feeling adventurous and trust your luck, order it. If it works well, its a steal. But if it doesn't like mine, be ready for some big time disappointment and frustration.",

A phone that can't withstand a couple of drops is totally useless. When I went to the Moto Service center, they were totally not interested in looking at the product and said that they charge 450 bucks just to look into the damage. This is really pathetic and unacceptable. In this day and age, Micromax and Xolo have better phones, and they provide better service. Flipkart are not willing to help me. The phone is useless. They are cheating people, and flipkart is not doing anything about it. I really demand a replacement as I am not the first person facing this problem.",

            "comment": "I have been using Moto G (2nd Gen) last 3 weeks means flipkart deliver me on 5th december, 2014.Good delivery speed frm flipkart with WS Retail seller. But i face some problem which i tell both Motorola care & flipkart care but no body can solve this issue. Now m going 2 share some thing abt this phone. If u have 3G net pack then nobody want to get 2g speed and network So many customer facing the main problem of 3G/WCDMA network in Moto G (2nd Gen) always in dual mode . In india as we know that signal strength in 3G network is not good so in Dual mode Moto phones due to their internal phone setting always prefered 2 g network even if select in 3g network in your phone setting.I told this issue to motorola customer toll free care and flipkart care but no body solve this issue. They told me in this series of moto phone in 3g always in dual mode. Now i have to solve this issue my self and any moto customer can do this procedure as in below Now, Open your Phone (Dialler) app{the one which you open while dialling a number}. Enter this code: *#*#4636#*#* An app known as \"Testing\" will be launched. Touch the first option \"Phone information\".Don't touch other options. You will notice a drop-down option above \"turn off Radio\" button. Tap on it. Select the third option \"WCDMA Only\". Wait for a while... You will see that network has changed to 3G mode in the notification bar. If network doesn't change, touch the \"turn off Radio\" button. you will see your phone's signal are lost. Now again turn it on by tapping on the same button. Your 3G/HSPA/UMTS must have been enabled now. CAUTION: Inside the 'Testing' app, don't touch the other settings unless you are sure about them or you will land up in trouble & PHONE MAY DAMAGE. TIP: If you think remembering or dialling the code is difficult, then you can download the \"Phone Testing\" app from Play Store. It directly opens the \"testing\" options in 1 tap. But i think Motorola now lenvo should slove this problem.Other Android smart phone maker like Samsung, Micromax have 3 option in their phone setting like u can select Dual mode (2g/3g) or only 2G OR Only 3G/Wcdma.I think Motorola should learn from other manufacturer phone maker and other thing listed in below. Sound quality is very bad means feel very cracking sound when u are talking to someone no clear voice. irritate to me. Signal catching strength during travelling specially when u inter in roaming is LOST.Again U have to search network by manually. Congratulate for very good build and design. No problem in carrying ur phone. Display is good & you can update your phone software both in 3G and Wi-fi (WHEN LOLIPOP UPADTE IS AVAILABLE) Battery take so much time to charge and drain early if continuously connect in Wi-fi not suited for high end gaming it may be 2500 Mah but in this price range it's ok. LED light always glow in white not Colorful even if u select other Colour from settting. Moto should pay attention becoz of other phone maker even Micromax giving colorful Notification light Battery and Phone Signal Notification is not colorful and don't show percentage charge battery, u have to download apps from paly store for percentage. U can not record audio songs when u are listening Fm. Very disturb ur mood I think Motorola now Lenvo should come forward and solve this issue.",

The phone had a problem with ear speaker which I felt was not working properly from Day1 and slowly it got worsened. Motorola guys repaired the phone and gave it back to me but they never resolved the issue. I went to the service center and tried check the phone and the phone was still not working. In spite of telling customer care people that this was not software issue they did a software update and never tried to check if phone was working or not. I re-submitted the phone to them at the same time so I gave this phone back to them to get it fully repaired. The phone is still with the service center from past 2 months and they are unable to even trace the issue with the phone. I would never recommend anyone to ever buy a Motorola product.",

Loss of signal - The cell signal seems to drop randomly and it never fetches again .We need to restart the device. Most horrible thing is we wont know when it is dropping.Once it is dropped then we will be Not Reachable i.e no one can call us. 2. Turn on problems - Even if you click on the power button it does not turn on, acts like switched off mobile. The solution provided in moto site is plug it in charger and hold on Volume down key and the Power key for more than two minutes.They said they will resolve it soon. 3. Camera Flash light - Sometimes the flashlight doesn't turn off even after taking photo we need to restart the device. I think most of my friends are facing these issues.Anyway there is no other option to wait till moto gives an update to these issues.",

            "comment": "The successor to the 2013 stunner is more of a incremental update, nothing more than that. The fact that I call it incremental is because they have increased the screen size (which decreases the pixel density) , upgraded the cameras from 5 and 1.3 to 8 and 2mp respectively, added the sd card slot and yes of course it ships with Kitkat 4.4.4. The fact that motorola could have used an upgraded processor Snapdragon 410 instead of 400 and bumped up the ram to 2gb which is possible ( see Asus Zenfone 5 for example) and still havent used it takes one star away from it. Now as per my review I have used this device for a week now and have probably tested every aspect of it. As usual we'll have pros and cons as it has been ritualised in flipkart reviews :P PROS 1. Screen, the 720p screen streched over 5 inches, never lets you feel that the pixel density has suffered, in my view though it is an IPS display with Corning gorilla glass 3 on it but it looks and feels just like an AMOLED. Colours are bright and display fares well when viewed in direct sunlight. 2. Software, Kitkat 4.4.4 out of the box provides an experiences just like stock android and actually it is stock android with google now launcher and a few of motorola's apps which are usable especailly the migrate app which helps you in transferring your data from your older phone, and yes since it's stock android you'll get the lollipop 5.0 update weeks after nexus devices get it. 3. Call quality, Motorola made the first mobile phone in the world , so it would not be an overstatement to say that call quality is amazing and havent dropped a single call or had problem in sound clarity over the last week or so, both the speakers work well while calling. 4. Design, some may argue with this but the design is also one of its pros and the overall feel doesnt make you feel that it is a sub 15k phone, well done motorola with the curved design. 5. SD card support, since you get only 12 gb internal storage adding a SD card support has certainly helped moto g overcome a big drawback from last year, it allows you to expand upto 32 gb alongwith which is decent. 6. Performance, overall a strong contender for your daily driver as it offers fluid and smooth performance to breeze through all your social needs and youtube as well as some serious games. CONS 1. Battery, even with moderate to low usage this phone struggles to keep pace and avg battery time would be around 8 hrs with low usage and 5-6 with moderate usage with screen brightness set at auto. 2. Inconsistent Front Firing speakers, you expect the speakers to be loud, but at times they are too loud and the other its like someone whispering something in your ears. 3. Headset, The one provided within the box are of cheap quality, and it will definitely hurt your ears if you use it to watch a movie or so. 4. It takes time to charge the battery up even though its just 2070 mah 5. Ram, 1 GB in my view isnt enough when Asus can accomodate 2GB ram in the similar price tag then moto should have atleast bumped up the ram. Since I tested almost every app and game you can to determine phone's strength while testing fifa 14, nfs most wanted , gta san andreas the absence of sufficient amount of ram was felt. But for daily usage without heavy duty tasks this phone is smooth as butter though lags due to heavy duty apps. 6. Camera, though the primary camera shoots slomo videos at 720p(without audio) the cameras just make you feel you are holding a budget phone. Lack of 1080p video recording even though the chipset supports it, inconsistent photos sometimes over saturated and sometimes under saturated, even the HDR mode provides lacklusture photos as compared to my SE Xperia Pro (2011 made) the camera just gives up. VERDICT The phone looks and feels like a premium phone and is pocket friendly and gives you the performance you expect from a phone in this price tag, lags a bit when installed lots of apps but will surely sail you through all your daily requirements. In the end YES it's a bang for buck device. GO FOR IT!",

            "comment": "My first review here on flipkart. Its been more than a month since I purchased the new moto g and the time is just right to pen down my thoughts about it after spending almost every hour with this beauty for a month. First and foremost, kudos to the Flipkart team for delivering it ahead of schedule. When it comes to the device itself, let me tell you it currently is the undisputed king of the mid range tier of smartphones. I dont think any other OEM has a device on the market that offers a phone with a snapdragon 400, 1 gig of RAM and a promise of timely updated for less than 15K. Im excluding the likes of phones with those stupid mediatek crap and the ones with intel (asus zenfone) as im still skeptical about those phones when it comes to the performance, developer support and so on. I also exclude xiaomi because xiaomi phones are still hard to get and you have to rely on third party sites like ebay, olx etc to buy one and there are chances of many being fake. Beware! Ill put down some pros and cons. Please read them (you can thank me later) ;). Pros: Build: The phone has a very good build quality. Has an easily removable back panel which has a rubberized matte finish to it. The phone is slim and feels good to hold. You get the feeling of holding a premium phone. The power and volume button are very responsive though they feel a bit wobbly. Performance: I couldnt have been happier. The phone is extremely snappy. One of the advantages of running stock, clean android without any gimmicky junk that other OEMs add. Backed by a powerful mid-range processor the snapdragon 400 and 1 gig of RAM, this should suffice for everyday needs with occasional gaming. I tried playing dead trigger 2, which runs smooth 90% of the times and asphalt 8, which I felt it was laggy. But a couple of other reviews showed asphalt 8 running smoothly. Call quality: I dont tend to get too many voice calls but I am more than satisfied with what the phone offers as I dont have to repeat what I have said to the person on the other end and I can also hear the other person clearly.. Storage: The new moto g comes with 16 gigs of storage and now comes with the ability to expand it via a micro sd card upto 32 gigs. Out of 16 gigs you get about 12-13 gigs of usable space. So I think all your storage needs are covered. Battery life: Battery life is subjective and depends from person to person. The new moto g has the same battery as that of its predecessor. A non user replaceable 2070 mAh battery. Im a bit surprised that they havent bumped up the battery in proportion to the screen size. But nevertheless im able to squeeze out 7-8 hours of battery on an average with about 2-2.5 hrs of screen on time. Display: The new moto g comes with a 5 inch HD (1280X720P) display. One thing that catches my attention is the incredibly thin bezels. Viewing angles are good, colour reproduction is decent. Watching movies and videos are a pleasure. The phone played almost any video I threw at it. Including a heavily encoded 1080p movie. Though you need to install a 3rd party video app called MX player from google play store. Sound: The new moto g comes with dual front facing stereo speakers and man I must say its a pleasure to hear something play via the speakers. Though not like boom sound of HTC, I must say im more than happy with what motorola is offering. No problems with the ringer as well Cons: Camera: I think motorola have compromised on the camera, I have no qualms about colour reproductivity, contrast and so on. But the camera struggles to focus many times, very evident when you take close ups. I am coming from the nokia lumia 720 and I am already missing the fantastic camera that it had. The flash is also a disappointment, it doesnt light up the entire frame, the light tends to fade towards the corners of the frame. Connectivity: The moto g comes with almost every connectivity option including bluetooth and wifi but alas! no NFC. NFC hasnt really picked up in India yet but its a matter of time before it does. I dont think many of you would think of this as a con but IMO this is some form of a compromise and I feel its a con. So thats it guys. Hope you liked this honest review. Give me a thumbs up if you liked this review. Cheers!",

            "comment": "After using Moto G 2014 for the past week my personal opinion are as follows 1. The phone's display is one of its best asset. Its big and has good colour reproduction and the image quality is best for the price. 2. The Camera takes more than decent pics.Front camera has better details for selfies Enough details and good colours for casual photography 3. Video's are good with enough detail though 1080p would make customers more happy( Anyway shooting high quality videos isn't much of a necessity for most people, the default 720p is good enough for your casual functions) 4. Google now is flawless and phone catches your commands good enough. 5. Even though the phone has the same S400 chipset the performance is good enough with snappy performance for casual usage. High end and intensive gamers may be satisfied with screen size and performance but the phone would get heated soon. 6. The default headset is of good quality but its not in-ear and the design awkward. Better buy JBL in-ear headsets than stock 7. Charger is ok but it gets heated up and cools itself later so dont worry about it. 8. Use official micro sim rather than using a trimmed sim. My trimmed sim had connectivity issues 9. A guaranteed L update and a active development community support makes it a better option than most micromaxx, karbon phones (I personally dont prefer the indian branded china sets but its your wish) 10. The phone has 16GB internal out of which 11-12GB is usable and apps can be moved to SD too. Didn't check OTG. So thats all about my experience with this wonderful budget smartphone. The Phone provides nexus performance and experience at a lower cost. Doesn't has fancy things, but doesn't upsets you much. Its the best ans sensible choice for a casual user on a normal budget",

I gave an order of Moto G 2nd generation worth Rs. 12999. 1) First time I got a set which was getting over heated and had a scratch and had black dots on the screen. 2) Second in the replacement I got a set which had a scratch visible in the front and had network issues. then I got fed up and got refund into my wallet and 3) For the 3rd time placed a fresh order and again got a damaged set with the back cover not shut properly. I am just frustrated to finally come up and write a review, we got more important works rather to do this. Listen Flipkart this is not just the way to treat your customers. Try to make them satisfied rather disappoint them.",

            "comment": "Friends, I am totally satisfied with this wonderful beast. Moto G (2nd Gen) is an excellent phone. One of the greatest bombs designed by my beloved Motorola gonna explode and repel samchung a.k.a Crapsung. I am amazed to see how can a company bring vividity to such an extent that it seems like I am using a device equipped with an amoled display. I think Motorola did proper SWOT Analysis before launching Moto G 2nd Generation, that is why there are no shortcomings. Let discuss its pros and cons. Pros:- 1) I have never seen such vividness in an ips lcd display. 2) Colours are well saturated. 3) Other phones have dedicated app storage but there is no such partition for apps in internal memory, that means you can fully use the internal storage for apps installation i.e 12GB. 4) This mobile supports microsd slot. That means you can expand its memory as per your need. 5) I never thought that an android device would be able to stand against my Nokia N8 in terms of sound quality. Being an Audiophile I always try to use the device that can meet my expectations. And believe me it has passed the test by a huge margin. 6) Dual front speakers give you pleasant experience when you listen or watch any song in landscape mode. 7) Camera is excellent although not as good as my Nokia N8 but you will definately enjoy its camera quality. Although front camera is only 2mp still it is better than any other 5mp camera of companies like mmx. 8) Built quality is awesome, I'd say it is close to that of Nokia's built quality. 9) Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen durable, although I didn't perform a drop test but I tried it scratching with knife, screw driver etc. but didn't able to scratch it. 10) Battery is decent, atleast I am satisfied with its performance. 11) No matter you are playing a hd game or a basic game, it won't heat-up a bit. 12) Touch is very smooth. 13) I have played almost every game on it and it was smooth all over thanks to its powerful cpu and gpu i.e Snapdragon 400 and Adreno 305. Cons: 1) Stock earphones are not good, but it doesn't matter I use Sennheiser CX-180. 2) Charger is weak, it takes almost 3 hours to fully charge. But I use Digiflip 6600 mAH power bank to charge it, as it takes only 1.5 hours to charge my moto. 3) Pure Android UI is not so user friendly. But still I like it. That's all for now. You can rely on my review. Unbiasness Guaranteed :)",

            "comment": "I have been using the Moto G 2nd Gen for about a week now which, I believe, puts me in a good position to review the phone and talk about my overall experience with it. Buying Experience: The buying experience was smooth and hassle free. I ordered the phone minutes after it was launched and the site (Flipkart) didn't crash and had thankfully anticipated the demand enough that the phone didn't sell out within minutes! The delivery was done 2 days BEFORE the promised date so all in all, a great job by Flipkart! First Impressions: Unbox and you see this slab of glass, simple, sleek and beautiful! Hold the phone and the first thing you realize is that the phone has a very premium hand feel! The build quality is top notch and the design is simple, just how it should be! The sides have a piano black finish which does make the phone a little slippery while holding it. You also notice that the phone is quite big but holding it is comfortable thanks to that curved back and the matte finish of the back panel. The back is plastic but in no way does it feel cheap. You know you've got something that is worth the money that you paid for it! Pros: - If there was one feature that shines on the Moto G 2nd Gen, it has to be those front firing stereo speakers! I was blown away by the clarity of those little things! Definitely the best speakers I've heard on any phone! - The 5 inch display is great! For watching videos or reading e-books, it seems to be just right. - The 8 mp camera is decent. Does what it is told. The camera interface is also surprisingly simple. I am yet to try the camera in different light settings but indoor shots till now have been good enough. The video recording is 720p and can also be done in slow motion. You will enjoy making slow motion videos on the phone! You can also take photos WHILE recording the video. Something that I wasn't expecting to be honest! - The phone is dual sim, very very useful for people who are always traveling between two cities! The call quality is crisp, noise cancellation is good. - External storage via a microSD card is a major plus that the original Moto G lacked. Along with an SD card slot, the phone also gets USB OTG. So external pendrives can also be connected via an OTG cable. Very handy to carry all your data at all times. - The battery lasts me 18 hours with normal usage, 2G internet, auto sync enabled and the screen brightness at 50%. If you use the 'battery saver' mode, the phone easily lasts a day on charge. No complaints there. - The OS is the vanilla Android and it is slick with no lags whatsoever. The animations and transitions are smooth, multitasking is a breeze. The phone never seems to struggle even when playing graphics intensive games. Thanks to the stock Android, the phone will be one of the first phones to get the updates. That is a big plus! - The Moto G 2nd Gen supports the \"Ok Google\" hot-word from any screen. Basically, once enabled, you can say \"Ok Google\" no matter what you are doing on the phone and Google search immediately comes up asking you what needs to be done. Very nifty and neat! - The phone has a water resistant coating inside out. Full marks to Motorola!. Cons: - The phone charger! The phone charger is of a low output (550 mA) and because of that, charging the Moto takes a lot of time. - Non removable battery. This can be a deal breaker for some people however I don't think much of it. - No data cable in the retail box. You need to buy that separately if you don't already own one. - The earphones that come out of the box are average in their audio output. People who take their music seriously will have to buy new earphones. - No external camera button, something I miss coming from the Lumia family of phones. - While not entirely a problem, operating the phone with one hand is usually not possible thanks to its increased size. Competition: In the mid level segment, the Moto G 2nd Gen reigns supreme! According to me, it is the best value for money phone in the market. Yes, the Chinese and Indian competitors are offering phones with bumped up specs at lesser price but none can match the Moto in terms of brand value and build quality. Add to that the offering of stock Android with a guaranteed update to Android L and the Moto G 2nd Gen becomes a very good deal! A special mention of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini, a phone that offers almost the same specifications as the Moto G 2nd Gen BUT costs twice as much! What was Samsung thinking? The Moto G 2nd Gen is everything that its predecessor was and then some more! The original Moto G was a brilliant device and the 2nd Gen continues that legacy. If you are in the market on a budget, looking for a no nonsense phone, the Moto G 2nd Gen is your best bet!",

Just the right size. Cons: I'll be nitpicking here coz there aren't many. :P 1)The front panel is both left right and top bottom symmetric and this happened to me more than 5 times in the last 24 hours: Phone lying on a surface face up. Picks it up and presses where the power button should be only to find it missing. Then realises that i'm holding the phone upside down. When I wanted to switch from landscape to portrait orientation and i flip the phone 90 degrees and display doesnt change. Took me a while to realise that I was again holding it upside down. This takes a bit getting used to. The only indication in the front panel is the front camera (which you may not notice if your phone is black) 2)No USB cable supplied. PROS >>> CONS :- MUST BUY",

            "comment": "I have purchased both the versions of the Moto G on launch day. My previous phone was the Motorola Defy Plus bought 2 years ago. I bought the first gen phone for my wife. I got this for myself. Here's my views on the various aspects Form Factor: I prefer the form factor of the 1st gen Moto G as its easier to use single handed and more pocket friendly. Display: The display of the 1st gen Moto G is brighter, has better sunlight legibility and has more saturated colours. The 2nd gen Moto G display is not as good as the 1st gen one. Storage: The 2nd gen Moto G is better due to the microSD card slot. This is what prompted me to buy it. I had a few issues migrating data from my Defy Plus. The Migrate app copied all my media files to the internal storage of the Moto G. Then, the Storage setting \"Move media to SD card memory\" didn't move my videos to the SD card. I used ES File Explorer to move my videos from internal memory to the SD card. Call Quality: Excellent as always with Motorola phones. General Usage: Smooth like before due to stock Android. I'm not a heavy multi-tasker and 1 GB RAM still seems enough for me. Media Consumption: Watching videos and playing games is better on the 2nd gen Moto G due to the bigger screen. Audio quality is good but I'm surprised that PowerAmp sounded better on my Defy Plus. The bundled music player sounds better than PowerAmp on the Moto G. I'm not sold on the stereo speaker functionality in the new Moto G. I think the 2 silver bars just spoil its looks and don't sound as loud in a noisy environment. Camera: The cameras in the 2nd gen Moto G have been upgraded from the 1st gen one. I haven't extensively tested the camera - its a feature I don't use much. It looks OK to me but I wouldn't be surprised if its not as good as the competition. Motorola has always lagged in the camera department. Battery Life: The 2nd gen Moto G keeps the same battery as the 1st gen one after increasing the screen size. So, the battery life is not so good, just average. Charger: Motorola still bundles the same bakwas charger in the new Moto G. No USB cable, only 550mA charging rate. I still use my Defy Plus charger which is much better - has a detachable USB cable and 850mA charging rate. In summary, providing expandable memory on the new Moto G was a good move. However, they should have at least put a bigger battery and bundled a decent charger with a detachable USB cable. I would rate it 3.5/5 but I'm rounding it to 4.",

As usual ordering and delivery from Flipkart was convenient and super fast. Ordered at 10:45am received at 4:00pm. Coming to the phone itself, the package ships with wired headset(earplug+mic) and a charger with a detachable micro USB cable. Unlike the reviews read online for units sold in Europe, the unit in India ships with Charger and wired headset. Its too early to comment on battery life and charger performance. Screen is bright and clear - 5\" size is convenient to use as a phone and for internet usage. Inclusion of a microSD card slot is an added advantage over the previous version. The call quality in my limited use till now since laying hands on the phone has been pleasing and very good. The speaker performance is also good. The unit supports dual sim and takes micro SIMs. I have set up SIM1 for my official sim and SIM2 for my personal number and data usage. On the first boot, the unit prompts you asking which of the SIMs you wish to setup for data/interconnect. Yet to test out the camera - but given that its an improvement in specifications over the previous 1st gen Moto G, i expect the camera performance to be good as well. Supports 3G - LTE support is still missing in this version. The back side of the phone has kind of smooth matte like finish - its not glossy. Further its not fully flat, but slightly curved at backside. Holding it is comfortable. I felt the phone feels slightly heavy in comparison to having held the Nexus 5, Galaxy Note kind of phones. None of the accessories were available at the time of ordering. So the the big sales pitch of 50% off on accessories on the 1st day of ordering was no help. Could not notice any annoying cons till now. Shall update this review after a few days of usage. Overall an excellent value for money budget phone that does not skimp on features. So far well pleased with what I paid for.",

I have the moto g(1st gen) as well. 1) After i received the the new phone i unboxed it and the 1st thing i did was to switch on the phone.. i noticed that the power & volume buttons were not up to the mark in terms of build quality when compared to the earlier moto g that i have. 2)After the phone was booted the phone seemed fine in terms of display. But in comparison with the earlier moto g, i played a same HD video on both phones simultaneously. As expected the video, the video quality on the moto g2 was not great due to the resolution of this phone.. The viewing angles on the earlier moto g was very good due to its higher ppi..!! The color contrast on the new moto g is not as good as the earlier moto g as well. 3)The 3rd point that i noticed on the new moto g2(2nd gen) was, when i put both the phones (both moto g & g2) on AUTO brightness mode the new phone's screen looked very dull in comparison with the moto g. The earlier moto g is very bright and crisp. 4)The new moto g2 feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter but its actually little heavier than the old one. 5)The camera is pretty good on the g2. The flash on the older moto g was lot brighter than the new one.. 6)Sound quality is pretty good on the moto g than the g2. 7)The SD card slot is a major advantage in the g2. After using it for couple of days its showing SD card damaged. The camera and gallery did not open itself when i had put the SD card.. Dont know if the device that I have has an issue or all of them r facing the same issue. I switched off the phone, put the sd card again n rebooted it. It worked fine. There is some issue with the SD card slot.. Needs a fix !! Overall it a pretty ok phone for 13k but could have been a lot better in terms of the hardware specs..!! Also i like the way Flipkart ships the products :) Delivery & support is good !!",

CONS: 1)The phone which i got had some display issue ie: Slide window dosent work 5 on 10 times so to make it functional i have to press lock key ,unlock the device and then swipe down the slide window. 2) No upgrade in Charger same as moto G just 550mA insufficient to charge 2070 mAH battery.MOTOROLA SHOULD HAVE SOME SENSE BEFORE INCLUDING IT IN PACKAGING. 3)Headsets are also same as MOTO G no major changes ,which are useless. 4) Battery less than moto G which had 4.5inch display,SO LESS BATTERY BACKUP 5) LED notifications only white colour,dosent work. have to download third party app. 6) Gaming:ASPHALT 8 crashes .basic games work fine 7) In United States it costs $180 (apprx rs10800/-) but packaging contains only USB. No power adapted and Headsets. 8) I have noticed sometimes earpiece dosent work so have to restart the device again and again PROS: 1)Display (HD 720p) 2)Improved Camera 8mp rear,2mp front 3)Stereo Speaker in front. 4) Usefull default apps like : Moto Alert,Moto Assist... Disclaimer: I have used MOTO G1 and the above review summarizes the issues I faced with the device. It is not my intention to blame the product or the seller. Reccomendations:Use samsung Charger and Samsung headsets for better performance.",

But I found a lot of major issues with my phone. 1. the phone speaker was crackling , even for simple moto notification ringtone. 2.when you recieve a call , the phone ringtone is heard after a long delay of say 10 secs. 3. while charging , the notification LED does not come ON. Nor when charge complete. 4. charger supplied is very poor quality , only 550mA. Takes long time to charge. This phone requires minimum 1 A charger. 5.Phone looks very symmetric , so somtimes you end up holding it upside down when you get a call . there should have been a MOTO name on top. display looks OK and No lag.Battery life was good. overall a good phone ,but dejected with sound quality, which is like that of chinese phones. Asked for a replacement 4 days back, but still no response from flipkart. Looks like they have recived lots of complaints regarding this cell , and waiting for update from MOTOROLA company. The REPLACEMENT phone has an excellant and crisp display. earlier one had a bit dull display. The led notification issue while charging is still there , may be its the same in all the phones. DESPITE being an HTC ONE X+ user , I am totally satisfied with this phone and its high quality. Overall a must buy . Excellent quality for price.Flip Cover makes it look like premium phone. battery lasts for 2 and half days with substantial wifi use.",

            "comment": "First of all, great service from Flipkart who delivered 2 days before the estimated date. The package arrived in the best condition with the manufacturer's seal intact. I am waiting for the accessories to be available so that I can buy some of them. Anyways, before I talk about the phone, let me tell you where I come from. I have been a steady fan of Nokia Symbian phones and have been extremely skeptical of Android and the phones they come in. I have been using a Nokia 5800 for many years and then I had tried the Sony Xperia Mini for some time and I didn't like it(very low battery performance and too buggy android). So, I had moved back to Nokia Symbian by buying the Nokia 808 Pureview and had been using it for the last couple of years. So, finally after hearing so much good info about Motorola phones as well as the new Android versions, I decided to give it a try and since google owns Motorola now(although temporarily), and since the technical specs to price ratio is insanely on the good side for consumers, I bought this new Moto-G. First impressions. This phone is big with a big screen. My earlier 808 was of size 4-inch and for some strange reason I expected the Moto-G to be not different by this much. Anyways, this size is the maximum I can handle for a phone, at-least based on my palm size. People with bigger hands will find this more comfortable to use. The 720p display looks good. I have seen Sony's much hyped Triluminous Bravia powered display when I saw the Xperia Z Ultra at a store. The Moto-G's screen appears to be just as good, especially when you crank up the brightness. Everything is perfectly clear and sharp and unless I look at it closely with a lens, I would say this phone's display is as good as apple's retina display. The touch response is very quick with latency thats almost as low as the iOS devices(try playing drum apps in both and you'll see what I mean). The body of the phone appears to be well built and sturdy unlike the previous android phone that I owned(same price) and one thing to note here is that the whole body is dust and finger-print resistant. Motorola claims to have the gorilla glass 3 with this phone. Looks like thats good too (Accidently put the phone in my pocket with my car keys and not a single dent or scratch) :) The battery appears to last as Motorola claims, unlike what I heard with the first generation Moto-Gs. I hope its not because this is the early days since purchase :) Performance. There is a big surprise here for me atleast. The data transfer between your external micro-SD card and the internal memory happens at 20MB/s. I saw this when I tried copying my music from my micro-SD card to the internal memory so as to format the card using the phone. The stock android doesn't come with a file manager in this phone. So, I use this 3rd party file manager called ES File Explorer. The quad-core CPU appears to be great giving no lags on HD video playback and gaming. Although I wouldn't recommend trying to run big uncompressed HD videos as it can't handle it. For gaming, I tried running NFS hot Pursuit and it worked great. Works exactly as how it does in my iPad. Android Kitkat is way better in terms of performance than Jelly Bean or ICS and that transcends complemented by the quad-core CPU. So, to conclude, the 2nd Gen Moto-G is the best phone you can ever get for that price in the market. No other phone in that price range is even close. So, its a must buy for anyone who is looking for a decent android based smart-phone. I mean, based on what I see here, one has to be almost crazy to go for the high-end models from leading manufacturers that are priced atleast 4-5 times the price of this phone. It really shows how cheap the technology really is and how most manufacturers are overcharging for their products.",

Two speakers 5. curve shape gives Better grip and feels lighter (although it is heavier) 6. Micro SD slot 7 Ok Google and Motorola Assist (Context based Voice assistance) works smoothly 8. Better speakers 9. Dual mics for better voice quality .... Cons: 1. Still User experience is not the best 2. No USB cable or memory card in box 3. Non replaceable battery 4.

            "comment": "Moto G It is almost certain that MOTO G is a great phone at this price point...nowadays it became a trend that last year flagships are becoming this years mid-range devices. its true in the case of Moto G Delivery for the first time am disappointed with flipkart.I ordered the device on Friday midnight, It was delivered to me by Monday night 9PM.Even though it reached my nearest hub on Saturday morning itself. Out of the box, this device looks stunning,with the little upgrade from the previous version.they have compromised some PPI count,but is not the big deal at all.it looks same and sharp. Device fits nicely in the hands, comfortable to use it with single hand.Kitkat works smooth on the s400..nearly an year old chip set. one notable upgrade is the front facing speakers.Its not only loud but the sound quality is very much improved. next about the interface,Am not the lover of stock android,but 4.4 is smooth and stable.am happy that it can be customized to more user friendly.But I still miss my HTC sense experience which is more user friendly than the stock. Its good to have dual sim support, but as of my experience it takes more time for the device to recognize both the sim cards.For a moment I thought it was a problem but it is not. Am yet to test the device performance on gaming and heavy usage,but I believe it wont disappoint me as the original Moto G performed really well. And the next big thing camera.. Moto has added an 8 MP shooter with this,and its a good upgrade from the original one,it takes some nice snaps.Cam quality is better than some old flagships with 8MP shooter.am very much satisfied with the shooter. one notable thing with the shooter is that its bit faster than the old one,and touch to snap is very handy.selfy cam is also good. Battery am bit disappointed that no upgrade to the battery.Am sure this phone will not perform as good as the previous one as the screen size increased and the port for SD is included.but it will last for a day with normal usage. Moto offers a Charger and the ear piece with this phone,but they are not as classy as the phone charger cable cant be separated,and the headphone performs really poor. Most users have a confusion whether to buy Moto or MI3. It depends on what you expect from the phone. but Keep one thing in mind \"MOTO g is a mid range phone with the flagship Quality and MI3 is flagship with mid range quality.\" although MI3 has a greater chip-set it feels cheap in hands.I have used both the devices,Moto G feels like holding a flagship,and in case of MI3 i felt like holding a Casio calculator. MI3 is good on paper.but Moto feels much better in hands. MI3 has almost double the amount of pixels than of MOTO but still moto G beats it comfortably.remember MOTO is only 720p.its far better than the Chinese. \"If you need an uncompromisable daily driver then its good to buy MOTO G. if u believe in paper specs, you can go for the Chinese.\"",

Moto g comes with pretty clean & simple package & not to forget no USB cable & if ur first to android devices u might get disappointed for not having a cable. The design of the moto is very elegant & it comes with a screen guard on the phone so no need to buy one. Display is pretty sharp & crisp & viewing angels are also pretty good. Processor works pretty fast on 3g or wifi with no lags whatsoever after updating all the preinstalled apps & downloading lot of apps. It's almost stock android & 4.4.4 kitkat out of the box comes with some cool apps like photos, newsstand, (to name a few) not to forget the Ui is simple & clean which I loved. Chrome is the default browser & works brilliantly & the new UI of chrome is also interesting. As usual it comes with moto apps like alert, migrate, assist all does the job as said. I am not a gaming person so i am not going to say anything about it since i havn't played any games, but i believe snapdragon 400 can handle all the games designed for it. Call quality, is also very good (both loud speaker & microphone) without any problem one can hear the voice of other person. Motorola has supplied a very average headset, infact its below average. My old phone Galaxy s lcd had better headset undoubtedly. Most of the customers would be disappointed with this quality of headset. Quality of audio is very less & sometimes i find it difficult to realise which song is playing while I am riding on my two wheeler. But moto backs it up by beautiful front stereo speakers, they are absolutely brilliant & enjoyed every bit of it. Yes charger do get heated up a bit but folks if u had used samsung phones previously use samsung charger to charge the moto I have personally checked the capacity of both samsung & moto charger & both supply same amount of power or less (in case of samsung) u can check the spcifications on ur chargers. & guess what phone doesn't get heated up when charged by samsung charger. I have been doing it from last 9 days. Battery is pretty decent & it comes for a whole day with normal usage. I get a back up of almost a day which is fine for me. however one can change thier runtime from dalvik to ART in developer options for better battery response. Dual sim for those who love to have two sims & both work pretty well, signal strength is also very good. It also comes with the micro sd slot so more soace for heavy storage. Camera also works very well both rear & front camera photos looked much better in non HDR mode (personal preference) It also supports 720p video recording & it also boosts slow motion video 2 720p which is quiet awesome. Overall I really like the new moto g & i have enjoyed every bit of it.",

I was using 500 RAM always 200 MP available same here only 200 MP available. Most concern is battery -- If you are free whole day to charge and use then go for it... But I think Online purchase is not good for electronic equipment's... like Mobile and Laptops tab and all....",

It took more than 3 hours to get complete Charged 2. When i downloaded and played a high graphic game it was awesome but it lasted for only 7 minutes, after which the phone automatically switched off due to zero Battery. I guess Moto needs to work on battery...:)",

Even when i call them [I'm Flip-kart First Subscriber] they said they reach me by Monday ,NO callback yet from anyone. Now they say will get back at 10th Sept ...This is Pathetic ....Simply scamming Customers saying become Flip-kart First subscriber ,will resolve within two days....Hope they Call me back ...OR they don't post this review at all",

The phone is super awesome as the moto-g(1st Gen) and the cam quality had been increased a lot and thats a very good job done in this phone. I have purchased a moto-g for myself and a moto-e for my mom and now i have purchased this new edition for my bro. Now my whole family is holding moto devices. We are all very happy using the device. I have been using my moto-g from 9 months( i have purchased the global gsm version in US) and seriously there wasnt even a small glitch and the same from moto-e from 4 months and same continues with the new moto-g i hope so. Regarding the specs i dont need to say much everything is perfectly blend for this price range and handset. May be there might be companies offering you other features or increased capabilty but i am sure that for the price we paid this moto-g lasts long than other devices.. People who want quality , performance , proper service, battery life, connectivity and pure android experience this is the best buy at this price range. Flipkart u always make me happy. Ordered at 9:32 AM on 6th sept got it delivered by 6:20PM on 7th sept with no extra cost( BGLR-HYD). Kudos to flipkart. The only problem is the cost of the back panels. If they are reduced to a large extent then many would opt buying original shells or cases.",

            "comment": "Here is my Review covering the entire exp of buying and using it- trying to be non partial and practical. 1) Service/Delivery- Booked it in Midnight, delivered at 3pm next day, but m pissed with FLIPKART and thus had a long Mail chain of complain back and forth regarding the issue that they (EKART) do not provide the info of courier person who will deliver the product. I ask you guys, do you want to stay all day in home just becoz of a courier that too on a sunday, well you have too coz there is no phone number of EKART on internet and flipkart says thay dont have it either. 2) MOTO G2 Packaging- Very very simple,looks like a budget cut in the box. NO USB Cable- so they are assuming you already have one .!!!! (-0.5) Headphone looks very avg so i did not even bothered to try them out. 3) DESIGN- 5 star no doubt about it, the phone as soon as i took out of the box fell in love with it. M using nexus 4 right now, and this phone is so light and feels safer in hand, the back panel (white) is rubber type material which is good, will avoid finger print marks. although the weight is also an issue coz at times i felt like its a TOY rather than a phone. 4) Display- same a prev moto G. I am happy with the display with the amount of money i paid 5) Storage- 5 star for adding External storage. 32GB 6) Camera - Disappointed, 8MP, u kidding me. My very OLD Samsung S2 took amazing pics with 8MP. its more of a 3mp camera. The images are whitish and washed out. the front cam is even worse. could have been way better. 7) BATTERY- charging is looking slow to me, will wait and watch how it goes. 8) Performance - Its Stock android and with Quad core 400 chip, its working better than i expected. no lag, and very smooth . though i dont like the 4.4 icon in app drawer. looks to big 9) Sound- Sound are really good, front facing dual speaker are just very well tuned. 10) call reception- its funny that people now talk and concern about call quality in the end, well my first call came from home, and mothers voice always sound great. call quality is really good :) 11) Net speed: Slow on wifi , will have to check how 3G works. 12) RESULT : 4 start out of 5 and +0.5 for the awesome back panel curve design. For me looks matter 70% in a phone and 30% specs. so Thums up for Moto G. Surely it do not match with 14000 xiomi mi3, but i did not like that phone design and its stupid to first register than wait and try to book at 2pm...its just crappy process. its just a phone not my life,,so will pass mi2 for now,,, hope you guys find it useful.",

Now about the phone..... At this price range, MotoG2 has intense competition. I myself searched through an amazing range of choices, but in the end decided for MotoG2 for the simple reason that the quality does matter over specs.... The phone definitely looses out to competition on the point of lesser ram, older processor, lesser PPI and smaller battery capacity.... but it all becomes meaningless as soon as you start the phone... Its a fab product with no lag, very easy to use... simple, clean and very functional interface both physical and software wise... battery life has been good so far.... camera does its job nice but could definitely have been better..... I have been a very heavy and advanced user of phones (some of them have been of the highest specs) and now all I want from my phone is to have a responsive, functional and usable experience with a good camera and good battery while not burning my purse... in that respect, nobody can beat this phone at this price..... would highly recommend this phone if that's wat you are looking for.....",

This has an 8MP camera and I am not much amazed at the clarity of the pictures that I have taken with the phone. Real value for money. Till this day, I have not experienced any trouble with the phone except the battery life which too holds good for one day without fail.

This is the 1st time I have purchased Motorola phone and my experience with motorola is really BAD. However I understand electronic item, some time it wont works.But another bad experience I faced from service centre,JOB ID : AMSBAG004387, date 31st Aug they promised, it will be repaired by 3-4 working days.But I checked with them today(11/09/2015) I got a reply that they have odred for the display from Mumbai (Order No: POJBAG001242,31st Aug 2015) and they have no idea when they will receive that.And today is 26th Sep 2015, still I haven't received my phone,dont know when I will get that phone. I tried to contact customer care via phone and the response is really surprising . \"SERVER DOWN\" they can't help(2nd time I got this response). Faulty device ok Bad service is not acceptable. I feel motorola has a strong consumer base in India, but why they are troubling the customer like this. I am unable to contact anyone because of my phone is in service centre for last 15 days. I feel if anyone purchasing Motorola phone he has to keep additional phone, because God knows when the Moto will get out of order. It incur to monetary loss as well as personal loss and its incomparable with any amount of money. I feel Motorola is deviating from its tagline \"Hello Moto\" to \"No Hello\" Hope you understand a consumer sentiment and start acting upon this proactive. No expectation from Motorola, there is no zero(0) rating, else I would have given that. One last thing, if you are purchasing MOTO, purchase one extra phone, cause by chance ur MOTO is out of order, then no once can guarentee you that when u will get ur phone from service center. I am staying in metro city, I can imagine if the service in metro is like this, what how worst would be the service in trie 2 city.",

            "comment": "While Flipkart might pride itself on its great valuations and discount sales ( i think it is doing a great disservice to customers all over India)...Here are some of the reasons why... 1.While I did receive a Moto G phone as part of an offer to exchange my old phone - Im am sure that \"old phone\" which was in working condition would last longer than the product it has been exchanged for. 2. For those who don't know anything about the old phone i changed (it was already 4 years old so saying it would last longer than the new phone is a PRETTY BIG STATEMENT INDEED!!) 3. Flipkart will wash its hands off you once the device is sold. 4. Now onto the problems of the phone, it was a completely dysfunctional piece which was taken to the service center for the 1st time because the screen was completely irresponsible - What did the service center do they said its a software issue could be fixed and returned the phone to me in a couple of days. 5. That same day the problem persist I take it again to the service center(this time they say the screen might need to be changed) 6. Stuck without a phone I agreed (they said it would take a week however 3 1/2 weeks later I got my phone) 7. Hoping that all was finally well and I could get back to normal was the only illusion I had. 8. That same day...AGAIN the same problem began to crop up...and as usual I went to the service center to show it to them - This time they said its probably the mother board issue. Here is my question to the service center in nearly a month you couldn't figure out what we did in a few hours? If it was the mother board issue and the screen issue and the software issue well that pretty much sums up the whole damn phone now doesn't t?? And what is the solution for that? another repair and another tragedy?? BTW for all the prospective customers stay away from this product it is just not worth it...and for those wondering why were there so many issues did I drop the phone or anything like that the answer is NO, this is what came out of the box!!.... Motorola's Moto G is a horrible horrible phone that can only be made worst by a seller who wants no responsibility with the device a clueless service center that doesn't know what to do with the products its supposed to fix....but most of all by a dead beat organization that cannot take care of its customers interest. - Yet to hear from Motorola _ will be taking them to Consumer Court - A lost customer",

Even I was a little skeptical when I read some of the other reviews. Fact is, some products (an infinitesimally small percentage) end up with a hardware/software flaw. Rest assured, Flipkart's return policy is trustworthy and efficient. Secondly, about the phone. I have checked all the features of the phone that a layman can. Absolutely no lag; the speakers are awesome; perfectly good microphone; and I could fall in love with the touch. On the software side, when I bought this phone the Lollipop upgrade had already been incorporated (5.0.2), and the UI is pretty good. I could go on about this, but you get the idea. Go for it.",

Then after three month I found that microphone has stopped working. both occurred at different time....Even though when I had gone to service center (Dugar sales Ahmadabad on date 7 July 2015) at there one of executive told me its a liquid damage and your microphone can not be repaired under warranty. In fact black dot on display appear about a three month ago and microphone stopped working after three month in July . But the person from service center told me that it can not be repaired under warranty. I also talked with customer care executives about the clarification regarding my problems but they are not giving satisfactory answer to me. They are now ignoring my problem saying that \" we are sorry for your inconvenience.\" Your phone can not be repaired. I am really frustrated from services of Motorola.They are not even solving the problem of microphone. So which kind of warranty they are giving. It's really very annoying. One of executive put my call on hold Without notifying me. Again really frustrated. This was my first phone with MOTOROLA and now it seems to be last. As I stated my problems above.I really want to tell the people that Don't even think MOTOROLA service centers are good or worth solving problems. Don't go for MOTOROLA seeing that they have good quality service stations.",

Basically once the phone screen goes in standby mode and you try to bring the screen up by pressing the power button the screen doesn't come up. If you get a call on the cell the screen doesn't come up. Display remains shut. Raised a return request immediately on 27th June 12:23 am. Return request - 22597457. Since then Flipkart team is trying to call me and give a remote diagnostic of the issue which has not gone through. 5 calls so far and for one or other reason the call is not getting resolved. At 3:55 pm I got latest call from technical team. The call did not complete due to network issue. Next thing I notice is the return request is rejected with message \"The issue has been resolved between you and the seller. Hence, there will be no replacement or refund.\". The itself did not get through and this ridiculous explanation for cancelling my return request. Immediately I have created another return request no 22799982. Lets hope this gets resolved with it. Most dissatisfied with Flipkart service. Don't even want to give 1 star.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone on the 11th of June and received it on the 13th. It worked well for the first few hours and then I realised that the battery was draining extremely quickly. 1% in every 2-3 minutes! That technically meant that it would run out juice in about 3 hours. I tried factory data resetting it but it did not help at all. I then called the Motorola Service Center located in the unheard regions of Gurgaon. They told me to bring the phone to their center and they would check it. What they forgot to mention was that I was supposed to back up my phone before I went there. And that was fine because I quickly backed it up at the center. But what was baffling was that these guys forgot to tell me that they could not touch the phone for the first thirty days because I could easily 'get it replaced'. So I quickly called the Flipkart Helpline and they told me that I would get a call from their technical team at a designated time (in my case it was 3:07pm). But my woes had only begun. On the call, I specifically told them to change the number they should call to the cell that I owned instead of the one that belonged to my relative. Well, guess what? They called on the other number! And that number was unreachable. So, their computer rescheduled the call to the next day without the consent from anyone. I called their helpline again and they told me that it wasn't in their hands because their server would assign times to calls. I again told them to change the number they should call. And guess what (no surprises), they called the old number again! Luckily this time the call was redirected to my cell. The supposed 'technical' guy, through the smartcheck app, checked the phone from Bangalore and said that there wasn't any problem with it. He then asked me to carry forward a series of 'diagnostic' steps. He told me to go to settings>apps and then stop all of the applications running there. *Claps* wow like I did not try that. After that he told me to go to fastboot mode and reset the phone. *Claps Again* Wow! And, of course, it didn't work.. So I called the customer service yet again and told them that it did not work and that I wanted a refund immediately. But, yet again, I was put on the 'callback' list. I AGAIN told them to change the number they called. And yet again they called on the other number. This time I had the other phone with me so I picked it up and again talked to the technical guy. I had to tell him everything again and he asked me if I had visited the service center. I told him that I did. He informed me that he would call the service center and then would call me back and then hung up! I waited for 20 minutes for the call and then I YET AGAIN called the flipkart helpline. The lady on the line wouldn't understand what I was trying to say and was fixated on the idea of scheduling another call with the technical team. They told me I would get the call by the end of the day. So, I waited till 8 and there was still no call. I called them again and they told me that my request had been cancelled due to some reason. After going through four or five layers of positions, I reached the head. The head told me that they had called the service center and the service center had told them that we hadn't gone there. What kind of crap is this? And after arguing for some time, they again put me on the list for another call from the 'technical team'. I'm going to get that call tomorrow and hopefully now the next guy has some sense.",

I have visited service center 3-4 times all times they just say problem will solved but there is no such improvement and now they are not going to replace my phone as they are not able to rectify the problems.

They are killing their brand value by manufacturing this type of devices. Look for some other alternative. Pros: 1.) Good camera quality in daylight. 2.) Brand Name motorola. Cons: 1.) Poor touch sensitivity. 2.) Poor call quality. 3.) Poor battery backup. 4.) Charging takes a lot of time. 5.) RAM management is worst. Actual list is quite long, but this may suffice at the moment. Don't Buy it, even if they are selling it for 6k. I had it replaced from flipkart 2 times, third time i asked for my money back. They were quite supportive of this. If you tell them what the problem really is, they sometimes actually listen to it.",

After some de-bugging i found that removing and re-inserting the SIM card will solve the proble. But this problem was persisting so i asked for the replacement. In the new handset after 2 days same problem came !!!! I was shocked to find the same problem again. This time phone switch OFF and ON was solving the problem but again the problem was persisting. Also i found that once the phone battery indicator showing remaining battery as 1% even though 5 min back it was at 50%. after switch off and on again it started showing 50%. Also the gesture typing was not working. All this problem i encountered within 3 days of the getting the SECOND handset !!! Anyway i asked for the return of the phone and returned the phone. after this i asked the people who have this phone what sort of problem they are facing. i found that every one of them is facing some or other problem. I have listed down the problems: 1. Automatic call going to someone in your contact list. 2. Charger port not working after some usage 3. the pop up for SIM selection is not coming while dialing 4. the problems i have described above in my review About Flipkart: The delivery mechanism is good but when i asked for the replacement/return they first asked me to install an app through which they will found wheter the phone has problem or not. the customer care person told withthis they can detect 99.99% of the problems !!!!!. then every handset maker can use the same app and there will not be any defect !!!!!. Flipkart customer care should not ask this and make any such false claims.",

It dropped from my hand about 3-4 times and once in bucket full of water, but it is still working. So better hardware and Somewhat water proof. Sound quality is better than my previous Samsung phone. Display is pretty good. Sometimes camera quality lacks in dim lights but this issue can be solved using HDR mode. Better design, noise cancellation etc. etc. The only thing I hate about this phone is that Motorola does not provide USB cable along with this phone. So..Overall 4 stars.",

After hearing so much about the device, i decided to buy it. first of all i just hate lollipop. Besides that here are some points, 1. In the box we don't get USB which is an important part. The wire of charger is non-detachable. Besides that the charger is of very low quality. It takes 5:30 hours to charge the phone. whereas the device is fully charged in 2 hours by samsung or sony charger. 2. Earphones are worth rupees 100/- in local market. Completely absurd earphones. 3. Performance is not upto the mark. Its being 10 days after using the phone and the device hangs sometimes. 4. Touch is sticky. While swiping, any unwanted app or anything gets open due to sticky touch. 5. No direct Music access. For direct shortcut you have to make a playlist in google music and then in widgets the shortcut for playlist is available. 6. Browsing experience is horrible in google chrome. 7. Keyboard is bad (it may be bad for me only). I am using Swift keyboard now. 8. No inbuilt file manager. Must be downloaded from playstore. 9. I have left spending time on facebook through app bcoz its horrifying. ( That is an advantage actually ;) ) so in my opinion Samsung S3 neo is far better than this device.The all above cons are absent in S3. I have used S3 neo for 1 year and it never hanged, NEVER. After using moto g, s3 neo looks like an under-priced phone with lot of features, attractive interface and accessibility and most important, ease of handling.",

The flipkart person do not respond at all. Now i think flipkart sells duplicate product and the 30 days replacement policy just sucks. Flipkart persons do not give any response during the replacement. This is all duplicate products.",

            "comment": "Hi Friends, This is my first Moto Hanndset, was little confused wether to buy Moto G2 or Lenovo A7000 though I used Lenovo a6000 and now I already have a 5.5 inch fablet Honor 4x that is very uncomfort to carry and one hand use. So my obvious choise stands for 5 inch handset which I am use to for a longer period in form of Xperia Z1. I decided to go for Moto G2 (especially to use pure android with LOLLIPOP). Pros: 1)Design- I am totally amazed with its look and feel superb to hold in hand. the curve back panel looks premium and makes it quiet distintict from other cheap phones. 2)Processor- Snapdragon 400 chipset @ clock speed of 1.2 Ghz with Only 1 GB RAM. Though the Moto G2 runs flawless on above chipset but it could have been better by improving clock speed and SD 410 chipset. The RAM optimisation is quiet brilliant, u will get almost 500 MB RAM free on top of of Lollipop. 3) Camera: The rear cam is equiped with 8 MP and front is 2 MP. Both takes descent pics but u get some noisiness in captured pics when zoomed in. I slightly disapoint with it becouse Lenovo A6000 takes much brighter and noiseless pictures. 4) Screen: the 5 inch HD screen is brighter and balanced color productive. it is also protected by corning gorilla glass3 and eliminated with water coating. 5)Sound; The front faces dual sterio speaker gives a loud amount of sound. The phone quality is also loud so you can hear properly in traffic and noisy area. 6)Battery: The battery backup is little disapointed me, its hardly sustain for a day. only 8-9 hours of backup you will get after moderate usase. 7)Storage: you are getting 12.8 MB inbuilt storage out of 16 GB and it can be expandble to #@ GB via MSD card. So Here you cant ask for more. 8)Operatin Sys.: The Lollipop update makes it Ice on the cake. The moto Assist and Other lollipop features makes it Premium device. Verdict- I reviewed it after using 10 days and in my opinion if your budget is 10 to 12K then go for it despite of other cheap mobiles which promisses excellent on the paper but fail to deliver. 1* star reduced for Camera......otherwise the phone stands taller in every aspect of the features.......",

I am not making this claim in air, here are my analysis: * Mogo g2 official web site and the Flikkart portal, both say that the phone comes with KitKat and later upgradable to Android L. But Moto g2 I ordered came with Android L directly and no where in the Motorola or Flipkart website it is mentioned. (I do not have issues with phones per-installed with Android L, but no where it is mentioned for Moto G2 and hence that gives boost for my claim). * Product seal is of very poor quality, anyone can tamper and stick it back as it was earlier. It's like a normal cello tape with Motorola logo in it!! * Call clarity is not good, speaker is faulty with a background buzzing noise. I tried by disabling stereo output, flipkart technician suggested to change the cellular provider and test, this option did not give promising results either. Even a phone restore suggested by flipkart technician did not yield any good result. * My initial request for replacement was rejected as they suggested me to restore the device. Now that has failed, I have placed another request and waiting to hear from them. Hope they respect customer values and provide a genuine replacement.",

Am done with this cell phone and your product. Am not here to repair your complaint piece of shit. Its your responsible to check your product before delivery.

In kitkat Version It was working properly {I was seen it in one of my friends Moto G2}. I request Please Suggest me to solve my problem. Battery goes nearly 24 hours on an average use. Camera is great. Call Clarity is not so good. While calling I'm listening noisy sound, clarity is not good.The primary need of a phone is for calling .Its so irritating. Another bad side is Search Contact feature. It took a long time to open a contact and also took a long time to make a call. Display is great.u can See everything clearly under sunlight. Ram is 888 mb.

Very catchy in hand. -Back side cover has a rubbery feel to it, inside it is plastic. -5\" IPS Display with Corning Gorilla Glass only adds up a feather in its cap. -Nice finishing to edges. -Dual Stereo Sound in front. Pros: - Everythings goes fine with this device keeping in mind the configuration provided. - Smooth touch - Lollipop is a pleasant experience. It's simple and fun. - 16GB total Internal space out of which around 12GB is available to the user. Thumbs up! There is 32GB extendable storage allowed. - On-The-Go works fine with this device. - 8MP +2MP front shooters work really fine. Auto focus is great. Cons (Considering the low price tag, these are not actually cons but, few areas Motorola really need to work upon) -Experienced some heating issues while using camera for more than 15-20 minutes -2070mAh Battery is not enough for 5\" Display, we need to turn off auto-brightness many times in a day to save power. Conclusion GO FOR IT! It's worth buying.",

Display is good but not as bright as other phones, but you will be satisfied without any complains. Battery: I use whatsapp, Facebook, browse, checking emails over built in gmail app, less gaming, Youtube playback (less frequent), always wifi on and 1-2hrs of calling. With this usage my mobile battery long lasts more than 24hrs. Camera: My old phone has better camera over this camera. I am not big fan of camera usage over phone, so i am ok with camera. Android: it comes with lollipop version happy with UI and menu arrangements. Mobile at this price with latest android version is good deal",

This was the best deal, I got till now on Flipkart in last 3.5 years. If we talk about phone, yeah its a good one because there are plenty of phones available in the market in this price range with better hardware configurations. I was also in doubt before purchasing it with Xiaomi Mi4i. But, that phone is going to launch tomorrow and it was not sure that in how many attempts, I was going to get that. So, I tool my decision to stick with it and placed the order. Now, after receiving it, I'm totally satisfied with it. No regret.",

But to get connection from AIRTEL is VERY VERY DIFFICULT one. Even it shows that it is activated in your mobile, the AIRTEL provider will BLOCK it purposely. If you call the AIRTEL customer care they never give you proper and correct information. Even they never take COMPLAINT at the FIRST INSTANCE, if you insist to take also. After for prolonged struggle with AIRTEL CUSTOMER CARE, i did complain and got my complain ID also. THEY WILL SAY TO YOU THAT THOSE TYPE OF OFFERS ARE NOT THERE. FINALLY I GOT IRRITATION WITH THE AIRTEL CUSTOMER CARE AND GOT BAD OPINION ON FLIPKART ALSO. I did complain to Flipkart customer care also. I hope after that only, the AIRTEL network has given the offer. Even the FLIPKART provided the apology token amount of Rs.150, i am not satisfied with your service. How a reputed sales company, did the agreement with CHEATING AIRTEL COMPANY? IF EVERY CONSUMER FACE A PROBLEM LIKE ME MEANS SURELY ONE DAY, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME ALSO WILL GET SPOILED. THAT'S SURE. YOU ALSO WILL COME UNDER A CHEATING GROUPS. TIME IS YOUR MONEY.. BECAUSE NO ONE WILL BE READY TO SPEND THE TIME WITH THIS PROBLEMS TO GET RESOLVED. SO EVERYONE WILL NOT READY TO FIGHT WITH THESE PEOPLE. MAKE SURE THIS WON'T HAPPEN IN FUTURE. BETTER YOU MAY DECLINE THE OFFER INSTEAD OF WASTING OUR ENERGY AND TIME IN THESE TYPE OF PROBLEMS.",

I am one of those unlucky persons who got pre-installed lollipop I haven't expected this from Moto Brand certainly ... disappointed...",

            "comment": "Great Product from Motorola. Has everything needed in a budget phone. Specs are already given so I won't describe them again here. Comes with Android Lollipop (5.0.2) out-of-the-box. Minor Bugs in the OS ,, nothing alarming, an update from google will fix this.. still awaiting for that. Verdict: Everything works fine and great. Except for the battery backup.. but it is expected from 2070mAH battery. It heats up if you have multiple things working together, especially with mobile data / hotspot on. Donot switch on wifi hotspot and charge, causes fast heat up.. and that too to very high temperature (That's why 4 Star Rating). If this issue is fixed then its awesome! Bought the phone during March 23-25 sale. Got it for Rs.9899/- (Rs.2000/- flat off + 10% extra off with AXIS bank Debit Card). Must buy Items with Phone: 1. Good Quality Matte Screen Protector. (Go for Matte because clear doesn't suit well with this phone) 2. A good quality back cover.. probably Nillkin. 3. 16 GB external SD card or above.. (SanDisk UHS class 10 should do fine). 4. If you're a frequent traveler or do not usually have access to electricity outlets, I recommend you to buy a Power bank (6000mAH or higher.. Ambrane or Xiaomi should do fine). [All the mentioned items are available at flipkart itself.] Other Improvements are left to your choice and Customization. Kudos to Flipkart and its team: right from placing the order to delivery. Everything was smooth as butter. No wonder they're dominating the online shopping market in India. As a Bangalorean myself I'm proud about this establishment. Enjoy this product.",

Well i usually keep a wet cloth(fully squeezed) on the charger, coz I fear if it explodes(may be i am Overwhelmed). Battery back up is not good at all. Design: Better not to say, infact there's nothing much attractive design in it. Its just decent one. RAM: Sometimes gives slow response. yes you are assuming right. its coz of not enough RAM, just 1 GB. Display: Camera quality is very good.But face detection didnt work for me. I hope it recognises other faces. Touch sensitivity is awesome. Ear Phone is very simple just like for the phones of 7000 Rs or lesser. I am quietly satisfied with this phone for this price, however i would say,other phones having simlar configurations are available in market with much cheaper price like Lenovo A6000. you can try them.

The phone feels nice and apart from the terrible, awful battery life - it has almost never last me the entire day - it worked pretty well. Actually it was quite awesome, while it was on - so roughly 50% of the time. Then the Lollipop update came along. So much fanfare, so much excitement. Disaster. The problems I face after the lollipop update often make me want to forget about the money i have sent on the phone and get a new one. Here's a list of the issues: *Phone stops making calls. Tapping on call - whether in the dialler or anywhere will not work. You have to restart teh phone, sometimes more than once. *You get locked out. The unlock screen will not appear. You can sometimes get in by double-tapping a notification and bringing up an unlock screen then. *It often slows down enormously and won't open things, hangs, arbitrarily closes apps. *It often drops data. That's a lot of horrible things. But I have to admit, it *was* quite good until Lollipop update. if you buy it don't upgrade, and get a battery pack. If you think this is just me, 3 people I know have similar issues with the same phone. One of them doesn't, or at least doesn't admit that it happens.",

With this 2nd Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone! With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around :) Camera is awesome even for dim lights, good battery, very smooth in operation due to 1gb RAM and quad core processor, excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy! There are already huge praises all over the website, I would just mention one thing, ppl please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money.. I don't understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phones look alike!! and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobiles! Motorola Powered by Google is the BEST combination anytime with unbelievable price.. I was not expecting 2nd gen to be this low at price! Hats off!! Also, If you have been delivered a defected piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Xperia Z1 was replaced by me 2 months back, that doesn't mean its a bad phone! Its just an electronic device, there are chances of manufacturing faults, check properly when you get, use it extensively for a week, analyze it and get it replaced!! Just close your eyes and buy it.. you will love it!!",

Flipkart is doing its own online analysis via Flipkart SmartChk App. For the past 1 week iam making calls to flipkart but of no avail. Please avoid Flipkart. I trusted them a lot until now.

I want to describe the issues with the phone. It's my 3rd day of usage. Cons- *Even though it is mentioned that the display is high quality. I can see pixels on the display. (Several minute cross lines on the display) * Notification light works only for receiving text messages. (Not for Facebook and whatsup messages) *You can't comfortably communicate in call while charging. I am experiencing small electric discharge in the ear grill. *Multitasking will not work. Application will reload. *Cannot install more applications. If do, mobile will freeze due to ram shortage. I installed 12 apps n 4 games. My free ram after powering On is 220MB. Also experience lags. I uninstalled few. Now ok. (Dont think that we have large memory so we can install many apps. Large storage is meant for files)( Facebook and optimizes r RAM eaters) * I bought official Motorola flip cover with it. It does not fits perfectly. But it looked so premium (I requested for replacement, I will let you know after I checked it). * Dont install other lauchers. I experienced lag when I do. *Initially i did not received signal for the first sim. After twice rebooted, problem solved. * Sound quality is good but not loud. * When downloading apps, the download meter will differ in the notification panel and the google store. THE DOWNLOAD BAR IN THE NOTIFICATION PANEL IS REAL. ------------------ Pros * Display brightness and color reproduction. * Battery life. *Design. *Weight. *Motorolla support *Premium look and status in low price. I did not requested for replacement as this issues are look like manufacturing bugs. I will continue my usage and let you know the facts. Thanks for reading.",

Many reviews already say about the great features of this phone and most of them are true. However, let me list down some of the cons that I see in it. Cons: 1) The ear phones shipped with this phone are way too crappy in terms of sound quality. The sound quality is below average which I did not expect. I used Samsung ear phones with this phone and the sound was much better. 2) Initially the charger used to get too hot when the phone is kept for charging. So hot that you freak out that it might blast off. Several others reported this in their reviews too. However in the past few days I see that it is normal (Surprisingly). 3) Thumbs down for BATTERY backup. Should have been better. 4) The back cover quality is cheap in Moto G g2. Moto X has a very strong back cover. Moto G g1's back cover was strong enough too. Other than these, the phone is excellent in terms of display, dual speakers, camera, videos, latest OS updates.... blah blah I would recommend this product to a friend. Cheers !!",

Really thinking about forgetting the 'Loyalty' thing if i don't get a proper product in my 2nd replacement! Waiting for the technical call from Flipkart. That reminds me, i have been waiting for this product for 2 weeks now, and still haven't got an actual working Moto G.

My phone's Motherboard is dead in two moths also when i took it to service ceter they told me that the sim tray is broken too. and i have to pay for sim tray repairs as that does not covers in warranty.

The mobile worked fine for 6 months all of a sudden,the charge pin stopped working and i couldnt charge the mobile and when i take it to the service center those guys are charging me 6000 rs for the service,Where i was promised by Flipkart for 1 year warranty.I am totally depressed with the flipkart product. You guys sell product that lasts for nly 6 months ?.... You knw the total cost of mobile is 13k and half the price for servicing that to in 6 months time... Flipkart being the largest seller you guys are selling low quality products. Spoiling the manufacturers name. I thought I am the only one with this problem in the phone. But in the service center ,I saw 100's of mobile given for same reason. Wat flipkart gonna answer me for this ? If there is no warranty for the product, Y you guys are promising warranty for the product? If you really insist on customer satisfaction, send a proper reply to my concern and do the needful.",

It has been 3 weeks today and I still have no update on the status. The service centre says the part sent by the company was faulty and a new request will have to be raised. Moto customer care support is no less, they promise a call back every time you spend minutes explaining the complete story but the call back is never made. It is really pathetic to realise that the objective of the company is just to sell the phone and let the customers suffer in case of any service issues. I would never suggest this phone to anyone just because the service piece is highly ill managed and extremely disappointing.",

Each one have its own prons and cons but I m here to say about MotoG 2nd gen. I got this phone on 27th jan and after nearly one month of use I observed some over heating under the base. This may be reason for over gaming or over charging but playing clash of clan, candy crush like cos this over heating than it would be serious issue. Even than charging is not lasting long under Wifi or Gaming like asphalt 8 for 1 hour leads to 40%-50% drop in battery. In this way for 2 hours we will lose all the charging so as to continue we need to plug in charger all the time.Sometimes even phone slows down or hang or apps stop responding may be heavy use of !GB ram which I wanted to be more like a model MOTOG 2nd gen. Other than I like this phone where much as we compare with other phones in present market. We got first Lillipop update which had all the attention of smart phonies and also the better update to old gen MotoG. Prons: Phone has good camera enough Front & back to take simple outdoor pics Memory expandable is a good update Dual speaker on front is simply good with music Wifi & 3g-4g connectivity is good Cons: Over heating may be gmaing or charging 1 Gb ram may cant take load on expanded memory",

Recently Lollipop was released and I updated the Android and here problems started, Heats a lot even if we use watapp up also and even while playing Small MB games also... Lot of time to charge the mobile, and after charging very soon U will receive alow battery alert. The worst Mobile with :Lollipop version. Please don't buy I recommend strongly.",

            "comment": "After going through all the great reviews, I bought a Moto G 2nd gen in an exchange offer. I asked for a replacement as the device had some problems. IS IT TRUE that what we get as a replacement will be a refurbished phone? Those products you offer on sale ARE ACTUALLY REFURBISHED? For example, you sell Nokia Lumia 1020 anywhere from 14,000 to 50,000. Shall I assume that products sold on discounts, exchange offers are refurbished and those failed quality tests? I got to know what exactly 'mass hysteria' is all about. This phone definitely is not as good as it is made out to be. Firstly, it was projected as a great phone. 'Word of mouth' made it a great phone. Those who bought this phone were kind of left with no choice but to tell others that this is a great phone. Most importantly, no one wants TO ADMIT THAT his/her phone is not really a good phone. This general psychology of human beings worked for Moto G 2nd Gen. Pros: Good looks, Good build Quality Cons: 1. Black mobile comes with white charger and a white headset. If you have aesthetic sense, you will agree that these accessories don't go well with the phone. Headset is of cheap quality. You can buy a better headset from pavement sellers. The charger is just 550 mAh which is not enough to charge your phone quickly. I noticed that it takes approximately 8 hours to fully charge the device. And the battery drains so fast that it will not last for 8 hours even if you are a light user. 2. Worst thing about this mobile is that it gets heated up even if you download few apps or a video. When I first booted this device, I synced my google account. So, about 20 apps started downloading. In 15 min, the device became so hot that the chrome bar over the earpiece could easily have burned skin on my ears. Immediately, I asked for a replacement. Flipkart called me and told me that if my battery temperature is more than 45 degrees, they will consider it as a heating issue. I tested again just know what would be the battery temperature. I have done the factory reset and downloaded all those apps again.Battery was at 76 degrees. Somehow they agreed to replace my phone. 3. Camera isn't great either. I took few snaps in daylight. Color reproduction was good. But when I zoomed in there were no details. Photos under low light really suck. 4. It definitely lags some times. Touch would not work sometimes. 5. I tested how WiFi works on this device. I started downloading Asphalt 8 on this mobile and my iPad at the same time. My pad managed download the game (1.5 GB) in about 10 mins. This phone took nearly 3 hours to download the game on the same WiFi network. Verdict: All that glitters is not gold",

Pros: Build quality is top notch.(after hand-on comparison with Asus zenfone 5, zenfone 6 , htc desire 816, redmi 1 s, moto g (gen 1), samsung S3 neo, Nokia lumia 525, 730) Best battery backup (non removable ) Timely updates Fits your hand perfectly (although gen 1 is better) Responsive (htc 816 is better) Brilliant and Vivid display (gen 1 has much better ppi) Value for money considering long term use. (Asus phones wont last long) Front facing camera is good (816 has better camera) Micro sd card slot (prev gen lacked this feature) Improved call and sound quality (compared to prev version) Splash proof coating Cons: A little bit sluggish after lollipop update Primary Camera not good in low light Earphone Sound quality is still just average compared to competitors. Little bit bulky and heavy compared to competitors. NB: Use armor case for better protection since replacement displays can cost upto 7k. Check for moto g 2015 update before choosing this.",

            "comment": "5 stars for Moto G 2nd gen. This is about flipkart service. I even doubt if they vl post this review. Ordered Moto G on Jan 20th under In a day guarantee as I am a flipkart first customer & payment was done through EMI option & there was a discount of rs.1300 on my card. 2 hours later I wanted to change the address & called customer care regarding this. They said they cannot deliver under in a day and said it would be normal dlivery process as the pincode is not covered under in a aday delivery. I agreed for that. On 21st they cancelled my order without my consent & sent a mail saying their courier partner cannot deliver. Problems started after this as 21 was the billing date of my credit card. As it was purchased under EMI I had no option to cancel the EMI. In the meantime the order was cancelled 4 times, cancellation was cancelled twice, refund done twice. Finally received the item on 30th Jan. Flipkart customer care(care?? do they really?) is really disgusting and annoying. they told so many lies. They told they vl speak to bank n cancel the EMI n refund the money to my card!! N some one said the product is out of stock n negotiations are goin on with WS retail to get it in stock!! About delivery dates they gave, less said the better. All they vl do is try to convince the customer by tellin cock n bull(shit) stories n say they have forwarded it to the concerned department which is dead I guess as nothing ever happened. Even they went to the extent of asking me to pay the EMI irrespective of the delivery of the product!! Beware guys. Dont fall for the nice words n false promises. They dont give a shit about customers. Once your money is with them u r screwed. They wont even respond to your mails. They wont commit to delivery dates by sending any mail. They vl just say it verbally. If u cal them thn they vl convince u. Thats it. They wont solve ur problem. They never bother abt customers. So I advice u to demand a mail for thr commitments n do not disconnect the cal unless u get a mail from them. Flipkart learn some ethics. You are here coz of the customers. Stop fooling them. I am really disappointed for being a Flipkart First customer by paying Rs.500. Your customer care is so so annoying and disappointing. Not at all service oriented. Just tryin to convince the customer for the blunders u make.",

            "comment": "I ordered moto g2 on 30th jan and it was delivered on 3rd feb. so, yeah flipkart has nice delivery, while others are not as fast as this one. Now come to the phone, 1st I like to say abt its design.fantastic form factor. It fits easily in hands even it has 5 inch display. Motorola designed it very nicely. Two front speakers are loud enough but not expect too much( it's not a chinese phone :P). Back cover is rubberised and not slippery at all, edges are curved and smooth and grip is tight. It is only a little bigger than my lumia 720.So don't think it is very big phone and it'll not fit in your pocket. 2nd come to the OS, when it was delivered, first thing I did that I upgraded it to lollipop. but honestly it is not good as compare to kitkat. I've used kitkat in micromax canvas A1 and that was really good one.Yeah lollipop has some animations and good interface than kitkat but in some aspect like menu and search engine goes white which I don't like. there's lot of problem in network connectivity which is very slow to connect and in my phone it doesn't show H+ only H or E. It is not very big problem but sometimes you cannot judge the exact spped of the network. 3rd is about perfomance. I strictly don't advice this one for heavy gamers. I played riptide gp2, contract killer, aspalt 8 and dead trigger. I found these games little laggy when compared to my canvas A1 which is very smooth compared to moto g2 in gaming performance. If you are not intersted in big games or if subaway surfer temple run are enough for you then you won't found any problem. Otherwise phone is very smooth and touch is too. 4th is display. No match in this range. Colourful, natural and Crisp, Not like samsung phones which has over saturated display.touch is very responsive and buttery smooth. 5th is camera. Don't except too much. I've lumia 720 which has 6.7 MP camera but far better than moto g2's 8 MP. but I don't want to say G2's camera is bad. if u want a camera phone go for lumia 730, you'll get better camera performance and camera app too and if you are not intersted in windows what can I say. :p 6th now come to the battery performance. Not bad at all. just turn off the mobile data when you're not using it. you'll get full day backup. In mix usage like net surfing and gaming I've no problem in battery backup. It's sufficient for an android phone which has 5 inch display so don't think childish like It has to give 2-3 day backup and bla bla. P.S.- If you want a good looking phone with best diplay in its class and stock android experience. Just go for it. I always prefer stock even in windows:p Not think for some UI and touchwiz which can only reduce your phone's performance. Good luck!!!",

And now a Support person called in telling the issue will take another 3-4 days to get resolved. Dear Flipkart, If you can't manage or provide with the offers, stop displaying them on your website. The offer is still shown on the page. But under terms it says valid till 31st Jan. If the offer is expired why still showing on the page.",

It was smooth even earlier before Lollipop upgrade, but now, it is on the TOP, the creamy texture and smooth OS made it even better. And after using it for 1 month and 18 days i have become a fan of Motorola and not to forget Flipkart and it's costumer service. My Next Phone would surely be a Motorola phone and it would be definitely from Flipkart. Pros- *Touch *Expandable Memory *Speaker *Lollipop *Camera *Mics etc. Cons- If you have heard that it's battery doesn't last much, than here i am telling you that its battery lasts for ages if YOU DON'T USE IT, haha Definitely, if you use it the battery gonna drain, yet it have one day battery backup and new lollipop feature tells you how many hours(approx) your device can run. Don't hesitate, Go For it. It is an awesome phone under 20k. it's competition is with Moto x 2nd 33k.",

There are several visible changes with Lollipop that require a few minutes of unlearning and learning. The update was very big though (around 360-370 MB). Fortunately, the phone is still working fine after the update :-) I purchased the phone under exchange scheme last week. Also got 10% cashback for credit card. Overall, was a good deal (though I still mourn my Huawei Ascend G510) for around 10K. Prior to owning this phone, my previous phones had slower processors and 512 or lesser RAM. This phone has slightly better processor and around 850-900 MB RAM (couldn't determine exact RAM because it shows values between 850 to 880 MB, and Motorola claims 1 GB of RAM). Despite this difference between actual and claimed RAM, there is no lag while doing usual operations on phone. One thing that I liked about this phone is that it doesn't get heated while charging or while using Wi-Fi or playing games (my previous phones suffered from this problem). Camera quality is good though I noticed minor lag in adjusting focus. One can argue about getting a plain-vanilla phone (Moto G) at a higher price than some fancy phone like Redmi Note or 1S (both with better specs on paper). I feel it is better to stick to a well-known brand. I have heard a couple of negative comments about Service Centers of Motorola, but I have not yet experienced them myself. One major negative for this phone is the absence of USB data cable. The charger has fixed wires (unlike other phones where charger cable doubles up as data cable). I believe it doesn't cost much for Motorola to include a USB data cable. About Flipkart's delivery - while these guys are really fast in delivering the items, they don't send proper info on SMS (to reschedule delivery or to enquire more). I got an SMS a day after ordering the phone and the delivery guy was already at my doorstep. Since I was at work, he returned later evening to deliver. It would have been better if Flipkart had sent me Cellphone number of delivery boy or he would have called me prior to visiting my home.",

However, my Moto G phone just \"died\" yesterday - within 45 days of purchase. No amount of charging or pressing multiple keys as suggested by their site helped. I took it to a Motorola Service Center at Andheri, Mumbai and was shocked to learn that the motherboard has failed in such a new phone. Further, I was informed that the spare will be available after 15-20 days! Hello Moto! Which world are we living in? Does Motorola expect that I have multiple phones - hence, this phone is so un-important in my life that I can wait for 3 weeks? Why is Motorola selling these phones aggressively on Flipkart when they cannot ensure basic build quality or reasonable service support? I asked for a process of refund and as I expected, the refund claim can be made only within 30 days. Hence, now I am stuck with this sad phone and pathetic service for the rest of the life of this phone. Seriously Flipkart, can you refund me the money or send me a new phone please?",

My phone has been with Amblax Serices, Delhi since 14th Jan and no one has a clue when this will be repaired. Try to reach Motorola Call center on phone or Chat and you'll know what I'm talking about.",

I filed a complaint for replacement and I got a \"new\" Moto G2 within 4-5 days. Now guess what, even the new phone is working in the same way. It is switching off whenever it wants and most of the times it says: \"Application X stopped working\". I am very disappointed with the quality of product Flipkart is delivering these days. And I highly recommend people not to buy any product from flipkart.",

Being an average user (45-60 mins a day) I haven't had any issue with the phone so far. The speed is good despite having multiple apps open. Downloads happen quickly and the memory space is enough. Photo quality is good except on a couple of occasions when it was shaky. I just wish the battery lasted a bit longer than a day with the Internet on.",

            "comment": "I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 months: Design: Looks very premium, probably a metal strip would have enhanced the look. But the feel of the product is very good and it sits anywhere very comfortably, whether in your palm, pocket, or in the provided space in the car. The rubbery effect of the back cover prevents it from slipping away from hand. Display: Not the greatest, especially in the outdoors. But do we necessarily look at the screen in bright sunlight. Probably if we are looking at the screen 30 times a day during receiving a call, only 5 will be in the bright sunlight. But the display handles the broad daylight well, although it does not shine admirably. Built: Very strongly built. I have a feeling that even if it slips away and falls with a thud, it wount break into pieces. In fact the built has a certain shock absorbing quality, which makes it one of the most strong products in the market. The next stronger phone would be a land line handset. Software and UI: It is a pure Android Kit Kat latest version phone. So there is nothing to talk about. My advice to the users will be not to download loads of unnecessary software from the play store, which you will rarely use. This will prevent the phone from slowing down. A phone is like any other machine. Overloading will always stress any phone system and the system may fail, whether it is the most expensive phone or the cheapest. And after all , we don't buy a phone and then test its durability and smartness by overloading it with tasks. Multitasking is a word coined by the marketing people and people who write dictionaries. For a phone, its not a necessary function. Its just there so that only a few of us, who cannot finish our tasks, can do multitasking. Call quality: Excellent. But sometimes it is just not there. There is silence. I am yet to understand whether it is because of the phone, or the network. My bet would be it is due to network Connections: I use 3G continuously. The connection is fast, even at very remote areas as far as far flung villages of Assam, I got top connection. But again, that could be due to good network, combined with a good grip of the phone over that network. Blue tooth, WiFi, all work perfectly well Battery: The most important aspect of a smartphone nowadays is its battery. I use another phone with over 4000mah battery. It never sleeps. It keeps going. But It cannot perform like Moto G. Moto G's performance, in respect of the battery that it uses, it nearly enough. But instead of the resent 2010 battery, Moto G could have put a 2500 battery. But there are ways you can increase the life of the battery of Moto G. Log off from all unnecessary prgrammes, which you dont need 24 hours to run, like facebook, instagram, twitter etc. Switch off location service. Dont go to known places with the Google Map on. Do not navigate to a place which you already know. If you do all these , you will be able to talk, sms and WhatsApp as much as possible, including keep your email services running. You may increase the sync period of the emails tough. It will save a little more of your battery. With these, and not harming any of my business activity by logging off from unnecessary synching, I use the phone from early morning till 10.30 in the night. Go to sleep after that. MOST IMPORTANT: Reliability. Many do not look for this. But my advice to you would be to look for extreme reliability of a product and the manufacturer's company background in terms of customer service. Motorola love themselves. And they will not let you down on the reliability factor. So if you have not yet bought this Moto G, Go for it. You will be a very happy phone user.",

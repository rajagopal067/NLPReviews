While my wife is using moto e ( purchased from flipkart) its android operating system is using only 16%of battery, giving much more battery life.(she is charging once in three days) both are running on android 4.4.4 versions. I don't know why this is happening.If the manufacturers fill this gap in their next update,It would be the one of the best phone for their specifications and cost. If there is any solution many users will be benefited.",

I am disappointed with inbox accessories. Charger charges phone really slow, it doesn't have earthing pin (required just to support charger). Earphones are literally 50rp product, utter plastic and it will make your ears red. All can be excused because device is giving back more then what you have spent. 1* is deducted because of inbox accessories.",

I have previously used a lot of Android phones like the Xperia ZR, Xperia L, but nobody came close to my tried and true Moto Defy+. I guess that is why I went for the Moto G. Build quality is good and grip with the Flip cover is excellent although I would have liked if the screen was 4.7 inch instead of 5 inch because it was too big for my hands. The UI is fast and responsive with less to none bloatwares, although free RAM was a bit of a concern because only 300MB was usable. It would have been good if they had included 1.5GB of RAM at least. Also, no 1080p recording. That was also a serious bummer considering the Adreno 305 can play 1080p. My Defy+ plus was (is) a beast because it never gave up even when I tortured it again and again with heavy drops, water splashes, and the Gorilla Glass was tough as hell because I never used a screen protector on it. Let's hope these things remain.",

OTG USB Support 6. 16 gb internal memory + microSD card slot 7. good gaming experience ( played heavy games like blood and glory , dear trigger 2 , asphalt 8 without any problem) cons: 1. i dont care much about RAM . though i find 1 gb is enough for me ...multitasking can be tricky on this phone .. 2. fair battery backup ,but have to charge every day ( 6 hours of display time with average use including 1 hour of gaming , 2 to 3 hours of net usage , half hour to one hour calltime etc) 3. if put on a cover , phone tends to get hwarm after heavy gaming or camera usage ) but not too hot , warm . i have tried to give u a unbiased opinion , simply best in this price range . only xiaomi mi3 is a better phone than this in this price range .. so if u are hesitating to buy this phone .please dont .. u will be satisfied at the end of the day ..",

I want to warn each and every one of you to abstained oneself from get cheated and feel betrayed. I want to share my horrible experience that I had recently WITH FLIPKART. Few days back I booked a moto G 2nd gen and paid extra for GUARANTEE one day delivery. I did not receive the product on the schedule date and when contacted with customer care they said it cannot be delivered on that day but it will take 2 more days. I was also promised for compensation by way of cash in my flipkart wallet within 48 hours. But this could not happen even after a week. Moreover to my surprise they said I have asked them to reschedule delivery and that is why this was not delivered to me that day. I cannot understand how mischievous one can be! How fraudulent one of the reputed online store can be! How unprofessional one could be. Alas! Even after this much of persuasion they don't consider it as their responsibility to respond to its customer. Conclusion:- good product but worst service. I am giving rating one because I was not allowed to give zero rating",

Call quality- The nokia feature phone has much better call quality as compared with this phone. 3. Charging time- When I received this phone, it had 0% battery, It took 4.5 hours to charge only 80% battery. And now it is taking 3 to 3.5 hours to charge 100% Otherwise this phone works great, as it has stock android so there is no lag. And battery life is also good, for medium usage it can survive the whole day. And now I m expecting Android Lollipop..! So, overall Its a good phone at this price tag!!!",

The display registers scroll gesture as touch, which is very annoying while browsing web. Also the buttons are not good and the power button feels like it may break. This is in contrast to another set that I ordered for my friend. Another interesting point is that the default plastic sheet on the screen had no logos on my set while it had some Motorola inscriptions on the one my friend received. Looks like it was a refurbished product sent to me. It is appalling to see such bad quality control on Motorola's part and Flipkart / WS Retail on not pursuing better standards. Have called Flipkart Customer Care and they have promised call back in 48 hours, let's see. Update : Received replacement today. This one has issue with antenna and is not able to connect to network. Tried different SIM cards as well. I am more and more convinced that they are pushing products without quality checks or are selling refurbished products to meet the demands. This is really disappointing. So far Flipkart's service has been good, though not sure if they are taking due care in making sure that the faulty product or batch of products is identified and notified to Motorola, or they are simply recirculating the returned products.",

To be honest my experience has not been bad but it is not great either. Andorid has apps that are missing in windows phone. In terms of Hardware or the OS performance I still feel that Nokia & Windows OS are the Best. Talking about MOTO G 2nd Gen. 1) Camera : 8 MP camera does a decent job. It is ofcourse not the best. But good for the price you pay 2) Processor: Well to be honest the 1.5 Ghz Snapdragon processor in Lumia 820 is far better than the Quadcore processor on this device. 3) RAM : you get just about 831 MB /1024 MB. 4) Phone does experience some lag occasionally. 5) You get a lot of accessories to choose for this phone. For prospective buyers I would suggest you go for this phone if performance ec is not that Important. My suggestion : Go for a good Windows Phone(1GB is more than enough) or a good Android device with atleasst 2GB RAM",

They've replaced it ,but given me used product which was in extremely bad condition there were so many scratches on the screen (screen guard) , phones looks so old and the back side was smelling like something burn inside, may be chips (due to heating issue). I've contacted them regarding this issue, they said to replace it again. I hope they'll not provide the used one. @Flipkart : Guys !!! I'm really disappointed wit you. From now, I'll not prefer buying product from FLIPKART.",

Camera is not so good bad but not so good as well...does focus properly sometimes..but it's flash light is very effective and bright..good photographs in dark as well.. Processor is simply great..very smooth for operating... but i personally facing the issue with its speaker..it's a loud enough but the voice clarity is so poor...even it gets heated for longer time calls ..sometimes you can not even hold phone near to your ears for longer calls.. you may need to use your headphones which are not so good..disappointment from motorola ... But the best part is google updates they are so fast on this gadget.. As a Google supported stock android OS (4.4.4..will soon get the Lollipop update too..) their are some drawbacks like calls recording and FM recording is not available..no restart button available...and the UI is sooooo very boring...but you can use launchers availables in market...motorola should have done some modifications in OS... But overall a very good phone from Motorola.... And most important part about Flipkart..a very good service guys ..purchased two Moto G 2nd generation so far..once replaced ..but now everything is fine... If you are looking for good brand and budget phone go for it...",

Memory card not detecting, Getting Heated, Hanging Problem Too much, Battery backup is not at all good. I have given 10 complaints but customer care executive are raising requests technical team is saying we can not replace on your address. While new purchase you are able to deliver now when need replacement you simply denied replacement and no reverse pickup? for refund also I have to dispatch the phone. I have given this phone as a b'day gift to my fiance. Now I have to ask her to courier this phone to flipkart. this is really a insult for me. I cannot trust flipkart now.",

Got an another replacement..... this time got an repaired phone with screwdriver scratches . At last refunded the amount. i think flipkart services are good as they gave me 2 replacements, but motorola pathetic . NOW SOMETHING ABOUT PHONE... screen size is 4.7 as navigation options doesn't goes off when u open any application. speakers horrible experience, but still not clear but loud... or try to change equalizer settings. camera is good.. ram is enough but cant play even games smoothly like deer hunter( 50mb). overall a very good phone at this price point , no competitor as such of now. BUT ONLY IF U CAN A GET BRAND NEW PHONE FROM FLIPKART NOT A REPAIRED ONE.... 3 stars for phone and somewhat service from flipkart.",

When I tracking it, the status is changing that unsuccessful deliver attempt without even communicating me and also cancelled this product. How can this happen without contacting the customer ??? They change the shipment status without pick up and delivery attempt I wrote two emails to flipkart expressing my concern over this issue and told that I paid for guaranteed one day delivery I need good service This is worst delivery service I faced .Still the problem is not resolved .Waiting for my product",

Its an awesome upgrade for me so far.......as far as the review, i have been using it for not more than a day or so....so this is not a review actually, just my initial impressions. A good budget buy, with premium looks and feel....and a great performer, keeping in mind the price tag. was confused with a couple of other models too.....asus zenfone 5 and huawei honor 6....but was impressed with moto g....and its worth a buy actually....atleast for me ;-) ....in all its a good product under 15k... To all confused minds out there, its a really good phone and doesnt feels a budget one at all. All individuals have different Priorities.....finally its upto you....in all its a great all-rounder.....and yes about the battery its okok, 8-10 hrs with normal usage.....as its been a day or so using this mobile....will list out about battery backup and few other things later.....",

I am writing a review about this Product after using it for more than two months now. Talking about some of it's key features: a. 1 GB RAM: Works great but may lag a little while too multitasking if you have loaded your phone with too many apps. b. Dual Sim (GSM + GSM): I'm using it for two Sim Cards and is working brilliantly for me. c. 1.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor: Well, yes. It is pretty fast. Quad Core Processor helps. d. 5-inch HD Screen: The screen is brilliant. Big and sharp display. e. Expandable Upto 32GB: This is like a treat. You have Internal Memory of 16 GB which you can utilize for all the apps that you want and still have ample free space to fit at least 2 seasons of FRIENDS in it to watch during your commute. And I am using a 32 GB Memory Card along with it, which gives a brilliant memory space for everything that you need in your phone. f. Android v4.4.4 (KitKat) OS: Well, if you are thinking of buying this cell. then do it. Because the exclusive surprises that Moto may give you in the upcoming months won't be even funny. Lollipop Update coming soon before anyone else except Nexus 5. g. 8 MP Primary Camera and 2 MP Secondary Camera: No issues and no complaints at all. Clean, clear and sharp images. Battery: Yes, if your cell shuts down due to low battery, it will take some time to boot again. Because it needs to get charged to a minimum voltage before it can start. That can be pretty irritating during urgency. The cell takes a bit of time to get fully charged but it's all good. Trust me, no other phone in the 15K category beats this phone & the only phones in the market which you will feel inferior to are Moto X (1st Gen), Moto X (2nd Gen) and Nexus 5 and now the obviously upcoming Nexus 6. But before you move on, a look at the prices of these phones: Moto X (1st Gen): 18,000 (Expensive by 5K) Moto X (2nd Gen): 31,000 (around 18,000 may be) Nexus 5: 24,500 (11,500) Nexus 6: 44,000 (not in the same league) So yeah, go ahead and buy it. You won't be disappointed. It will be a great time with it.",

Now I noticed a lot of bugs in this phone, doesn't have even average, speaker make a cracked voice while playing the music or a call at high volume. Having problems with 3G network, it keeps losing signals by every 2 mins while its working fine with other Moto 2g phones. Battery drains too fast even after following the steps provided by flipkart techs. Now I am very much disappointed with Flipkart's customer service, I request for replacement twice but they rejected it saying that all things is okay and this phone is naturaly in this way.. Now I need to file a case in consumer court very soon if you guys won't take any proper action.",

There is no good after sales support. I had a very bad experiance with this phone.",

The 1 GB Ram and Snapdragon processor pack a punch and with Multiple apps in operation, switching between them is very smooth. The display is also very good and Sunlight legibility is also quite decent. The stock Android 4.4 does away with all the useless stuff and Transferring my DATA from my previous Android using the Moto Migrate App was a breeze. Camera is also quite good and Pictures taken are quite clear and vivid. Call quality is also nice and the Battery lasted more than a day with Dual SIM usage and 3G network use with moderate use. Only Con I found till now was the metallic bars at the top nd bottom of the phone. They are a tad uncomfortable when u happen to take a call in a busy street and stick ur phone into ur ears. But on the whole thats a very minor discomfort and Motorola has lived up to its name. Don't think too much if u r on a budget. Go and order.",

Pros: 1) The design is awesome that fits your hand easily. 2) Screen is bright 3) Camera quality is good but not as much good to compare with samsung 5MP camera quality. 4) Sound quality is awesome 5) Performance is awesome, all application run smoothly, even HD movie runs without stopping. Maximum game runs smoothly. 6) Call quality is good with noise cancellation. 7) Touch quality is nice. Cons: 1) Battery backup is not so as I aspect, but all android phone eats more battery , so compared to other battery backup is normal. 2) Time require for charging is more. 3) Less option for camera and music modes. 4) This product comes with no external usb cable , you have to buy separately. But with all the Pros and cons the product is awesome.I think Motorolla and Google makes the product so amazing. Thanks for the Motorolla+Google product and also thanks flipkart for the service.

            "comment": "Moto G Second Gen was my first budget Android phone. For past 4-5 years, I have been primarily using flagship phones only from Samsung or HTC most of the time. I am really fed up with their never changing and ever heavier getting custom UI solutions which get in the way of updates as well. But when I tested one of my colleague's Moto G, Wow! A budget phone with this good feel in hand and extremely fast performance, it was almost unbelievable. This phone proves that the specifications hype is not worthy of all the price we pay for these Octa Core phones. Sure you get Octa Core processor and 2 GB RAM, but most of it is used for supporting manufacturer's own bloatware and custom UIs. Not the case with Moto G. The specs on paper are mid range at best, but due to the optimized KITKAT OS, the performance is on par with any high end phone. 1080p Video playback is flawless and most of the high end 3D games run just fine. The battery is also something that made me skeptical at first, but again, the number game is at play here as well. The 2000 odd mAH battery seems small when compared to any other high end phone, but the battery backup for me with moderate to heavy usage is 5 hours of screen on time and full 24 hours of total runtime on a single charge. On heavy usage, it reduces to about 18 hours total and 3.8-4 hours of screen on time. This is on 3G only, with Wifi only in the evening and morning times before and after office, about 1 hour of calling, 1.5-2 hours of music, half an hour of video, whatsapp and facebook at regular breaks etc. The only Con I can think of is the flimsy back cover, opening it is hard at least on a new phone and it bends as well. Plus, the power on off button is a little too much used and might get wear and tear in long run. Overall, its a great phone for a great price, for those who are looking for a Nexus like experience. I would say go for it! :) As usual, Flipkart's service was great, delivery was on time as promised. One suggestion I would like to give is to enhance the tracking system a little to show updates in a more detailed and frequent manner. After purchasing a product, the eagerness to get the product in our hands sometimes crosses boundaries :D",

Best android phone , budget phone, almost same features as Samsung galaxy grand 2 which comes at 18k.......which 5k more than this beauty. I am using all social networks, playing games, installed many apps...working fine, but after all this it became slightly slow but really we can't notice much. Only disadvantage with this phone dual sim + internet usage your battery will die very fast ......hardly 4hrs. Also battery chargin is slow........I donno about other phones batter backup. So I am using single sim with internet ....batter backup improved. Data also I tried to optimize the usage for better battery backup.

As far as the phone is concerned I am satisfied with its performance. I have made a list of pros and cons after the initial usage. Pros 1. Brilliant Display: Really liked the display. It is easily readable in bright sunlight. 2. Early updates: Curiously waiting for lollipop update. 3. Build Quality: The phone is very sturdy and feels premium to hold. Sound: Sound quality of speakers is very good if not excellent. 4. Camera: I have used Moto G(2013) and I can say that the camera has improved. The images turned out sharp and the colour accuracy was also spot on. Cons: 1. Battery: 2070 mAh battery is just not enough for a hd display, no matter how good battery saver app you've installed or no matter how efficiently the o/s manages it. A little bit of gaming and HD videos decrease a considerable percentage of the battery's charge. So you need have a power bank all the time. 2. RAM: It has 1GB of RAM which is somewhat on a lower side. You won't notice that in normal usage scenario but if you have installed lot of apps, while playing games you'll notice drop in frame rate. But that's only when you play heavy game(meant for snapdragon 400 processor). You won't notice a thing while playing casual games. Earphones: I my opinion if you're spending 13k on a phone you should get something good. Earphones provided are just mediocre. Very low on volume and no bass at all. Charger: The wall charger provided is just 550mA which takes ages to charge the phone. You can buy a 2A charger. Conclusion One can overlook all the cons for its vanilla o/s which results in slick performance. But the only deal breaker is the battery which is a serious cause of concern for a person who is consistently on the go.",

In moto g2 while choosing network mode its showing preferable mode 2g or 3g instead of 3g only like samsung and other handset. But in odisha as well as other state there is a lot of problem with 3g signal. Hence I can not receive high speed net as in my last samsung mobile becoz moto g2 cant receive 3g signal as the 2g signal strength is more than 3g. If there was \"3G ONLY\" setting available in moto g2 Than i can receive the 3g signal instead of 2g, where there is low 3g signal.",

All in all have been happy with Flipkart as ever. Has been a week since I have started using Moto G. Works exactly as I had expected.I like the design of the phone and it is very easy to hold and operate. Look & Feel: > The 2 speaker strips, in my humble opinion, actually give a pretty good look to the phone...at times it did confuse me though about the the orientation of the phone as it looks same from both ends except for the front cam on top...lol ..but thats nothing to worry about. Back cover is very soft and smooth to touch and feels great in the hand. Display: > Screen colours are pretty amazing, crisp and clear. Battery: > Battery is working very well, and after a normal day usage is only coming down to around 45-50% by the evening, when I reach home and charges back up pretty quickly. Camera: > I love the camera on this phone, though takes a bit of to do for getting used to it, after that it takes great pics even whn compared to other 8MP cams such as that of Nexus 5. Zoom clarity is pretty good. > Slo Motion HD video recording is the one I like the most in this for video. > Also the Macro pics taken from this cam have pretty amazing clarity from almost 1-2 inch distance. Auto focus combined with setting your own region to focus works great. Sound & Music: > Moto have outdone themselves with this one. The software coding for sound output is extremely amazing and the Media effects included with the default player have more than 20 diffeent setting for Wired/Headphone speakers or the mobile's dual speakers separately. > Stereo quality of the mobile speakers is great. When I first got it and was listen to some stereo track I had to literaly check that where is the sound coming from because the stereo is soooo great that it felt like the music was playing from behind the mobile. > Mobile's sound output to my 2.1 Surround system is just great and pretty pretty loun, so much so that 50-60% output is more than enough. Processor and Operation/Graphics: >No lags as of now and pretty optimized ram usage. CPU management is also well balanced, keeping unrequired CPU core in sleep/standby mode so as to save batery. >Pretty decent graphics with no lag whatsoever even on graphic intensive games. Transciever and WI-Fi: > Clear sound reception and transmission with a powerful tranciever, recieving signal strength even in places where my last mobile hardly caught any signal. > Wi-Fi Hotspot is the weakest area of the phone. The range of the wifi hotspot is very less and as compared to my last phone it is not even half of it range. The only drawback I have found in this phone is this. Still it works pretty well.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone because I was sick of using my Moto E (also purchased on Flipkart). Got delivered in a day. It looks exactly like the Moto E from the back, except that it is larger. The Moto E sports a smaller grille for the front-top speaker, while the grilles are of equal size on the Moto G. The placement of the volume rocker and power/lock button are exactly the same as on the Moto E - which actually doesn't make for great design. While using the phone in the dark, it is easy to inadvertently push the power/lock button instead of the volume /-, which can be very frustrating. The battery life is only so-so. I keep my screen at lowest brightness, mobile data off and use only WiFi, but even then the battery does not last for more than 6-8 hours. However, given a phone of this screen size, I guess that's all right. Getting the back cover off is a pain, but it is somewhat easier if you start by prying the back off from the micro USB port on the phone. The phone performance is good, but still leaves me wishing it had more RAM - especially while using apps like Skype. During voice calls, switching to another app causes Skype to crash or the call to get dropped - I'm not sure if this has got something to do with the Skype app itself or the phone's memory management. Similarly, while switching between apps, I often see that some apps load all over again after a simple app-switch. I am now eagerly waiting for the Android 5.0 update.",

This is my first smart phone and I am happy for choosing Motorola.Initially, I felt phone volume is less w.r.t both music player and call volume. After using it for few days, I felt its adequate. I feel battery could be enhanced with more backup time as it drains fast. Rear camera is good but front camera is not offering 2 mega pixels quality. Advantages: 1.Economic phone with more features 2.Fast browsing 3. Enhanced Memory Disadvantages: 1.Battery back up 2.Rear camera picture quality",

( non stop poor customer service from flipart) 4 non availiability of moto phones with other online shopping sites makes us to no choice to get from flipkart and my personal opinion that all moto products bust be available in all online shopping site so that we can have fair play since flipkart is providing poor serivice we can swtich to some other provide but this is not happening so blame on MOTOROLA 5 1 gb ram slowest amoung other competitors in the same price range, even though phone does it lag that much but once u load more apps u can find considerable amount of lag in the phone. 6 charge ur phone is similar to RAHUL DRAVID getting 100 runs in 375 balls ... i have used so many devices never ever seen a phone that gets nearly 3 hrs to get charged and i dont know wat charges are provided with this phon 7 another in box accesories is hear phone and very poor quality even micromax hear phone that they give for NITRO which is also in the price bracket is good. over all UNHAPPY with the device and very much FEDUP with FLIPKART service ........ motorola please look into the issue and help us ... one man cant satisfy all the needs of india ... lets try to be practicle and encourge fair trade and also there by increase the customer satisfaction. all the above comments are my own and i faced all those difficults mentioned as cons over there sorry to mention only one PRO is NOTHING. regards sekher",

Seeing some issue with edge/3G connection, not sure whether this problem with network[service provider]. it always go to EDGE which I don't want. 2.When phone is set to \"WDMA only\" and data connect lost for some time, data connection never comes back. after phone reset works fine. 3. Network unavailability issue, many times seen this mobile will not have network but at the same time my friend who is using same network will have network. 4. Some time I felt mobile is getting heated whenever I play games 5. Battery backup: I felt bad battery backup 6. HIGH SAR value :-( Pros: 1. Screen size, camera and extendable memory. 2. Up gradable to android Lolipop:)",

Look wise good too, sleek and with a little extra money you can spice it up with a colourful back cover versus the default black. What else do you want in a phone? I am very happy with my buy. I'm still trying to find faults and will update if I do. But none so far! Edit: Ok, I remembered one fault. The charger that comes with it is ridiculous, how can you have a non-removable data cable charger? It's a one piece, and apparently it heats up.

He says phone gets little bit heat but SAR retting is High than samsung phones but within limits provided by government of India. check ur phone SAR rating press *#07# and keep ur health better. i would like to say thanks to seller they have provided good product. But can u guys provide some offers with product or those who have already taken another product from same seller like another phone same moder or not same model vice versa. so they should give some offers or discount in cost referring old order no. so the buyer and seller relation of trust will increase and seller can increase their sell. It will much appreciated if seller will contact us and give some offers to there old buyer. waiting feedback or reply from seller. As i have already taken Moto G2 and One samsug grand Prime from same WS seller. I am planning to take another samsung grand prime but within one week WS seller have increased there product price around 800rs already there product price is higher compare to other seller then why again they are increasing price. This will affect there sell. I ordered Moto G2 on 29th OCt at 12999rs. then Samsung Grand Prime at 15056 rs on 6th Nov and received by 9th Nov But now i wanted to Order another Samsung Grand Prime but its price shows 15893 rs. Request u to give some offers or reduce the product price otherwise it will affect ur sell or people will move to other seller. Even also i am thinking same let see waiting for any feedback from seller.",

Now, something about hardware Glass is gorilla corning glass 3 N study frame. Overall strong enough in daily use. Software are something to talk about Google gives best software, but few are resource hungry For instance Google chrome which you can disable in setting but cannot uninstall. All software are good working. To sum it up this is the awesome product. I sure recommend to buy.:)",

Go for Insurance worth Rs 1000 within 15 Days from Invoice Date. 2.Sharp edges between Glass and Body at left upper corner so you feel uncomfortable when talking to somebody. 3. Music is good but not Good as Sony mobiles. 4. Motorola Flip Cover cost is Rs 1100 which is very costly. Motorola should reduce its cost and should provide it in Rs 500-700. 5. It heats when you use it till 30 minutes. Rest OKAY. I would strongly Recommend to Purchase Moto G 2nd Gen. Please donot go for 1st Gen as it is far better than 1st gen.

The 5 inch HD screen of good saturation will never let your eyes off from it.It never lags while running app or high end games.Battery is a low power one when compares to the display.But you can run this device on moderate use for full day with single full charge. Performance is good. Gives you an expandable memory and internal memory of 16gb which is a nifty.Adreno 305 gpu stands with high pixel games,videos and apps. Qualcomm snapdragon 400 is a basic processor but quad core gives you better speed and 1gb ram helps to keep up this. What else you can get an amount of 13k.",

Here are some of the problems with the phone 1. With 3G battery drains like usain bolt's 100m race and device heats up a bit but not too much.This problem exist in every device which runs on 3G . 2.In 3G touch doesn't work as smoothly as it works in 2G. Some distinguished feature that stand out are 1. Camera is excellent compared to other company like sony's 8MP quality is really good. Flash works very effectively. 2.All popular android games run flawlessly,I am not talking about big games like FIFA 15. 3. Perfect size to fit in hand and quite light. 4. Display is brilliant compared to micromax phones. ALL other specification mentioned in description is upto the mark. If you are first time android user then it's best phone to choose. Guys who are confused between xiaomi and motorola,don't go for xiaomi especially if you have something important data in your phone for security purpose.

But I've gone for moto And my reason is that Asus zenfone is quite an awesome phone in its budget and its UI is also way better than stock android. But the Intel chip under the hood even though its powerful it's battery hungry compared to the snapdragon in moto. I mean ya even this phone has less battery stand by but lemme tell you at least heating issue is not present. Its just warm that phone actually heats a lot when you use it a lot for navigation or gaming or HD video playback. Well, all I wanna say is heating issue is a bad thing for both phones and health. For phones because battery and chip set life decreases and health coz the radiation coming out will be even more stronger as the battery drains fast resulting in faster transmission making it harmful( not literally till you die) but just mentioning. But trust me there is no regret in both the phones. Any of the both just makes you satisfactory for the money you spent.",

Now about phone..i was in love with this and its previous version from start.I'm writing this review after using it for about 1week. This is my first smart phone.Now about phone... 1) Its charger is not having USB cable while most of other companies provide it. 2) Charger heats up like anything after charging for about an hour. 3) WiFi connectivity is not that good.It took me around 1and half hour to download asphalt 8,while my brother downloaded it on his Asus Zenphone in about half hour on same connection. 4) Battery backup is ok ok. 5) Asphalt 8 runs on it smoothly but after playing 5-6 races device heats up and game shuts down and doesn't start after that till device cools down. 6) It would've been great if RAM was little more. If i've to recommend it to someone then i would also suggest them Zenphone 5. Its screen is brilliant.. I played 4K video on it.It didn't run fluently but atleast i was able to see images. On the other hand Zenphone didn't even played sound. And one more thing its AnTuTu Benchmark score was fluctuating between 17500 to 20k.",

I got a manufacturing defect on the phone and I realized this after 30 days. So obviously I can not contact flipkart (they are hell bent against making any kind of exceptions to the 30 day policy) so I gave my mobile to the service center for part replacement. It has been three weeks so far without a phone. The service center is Sri Sai Communications in Secunderabad and they have three numbers and no number works. I called Motorola they said that the part is not available for replacement. So I asked them timeline when the phone might get back to me and they are not sure about that. I wish there was a zero rating too so I can mark it for this product. I wrote to the zonal manager of Motorola and no reply back from him too. I called flipkart again and they again said waioot for another week and see. Guys 4 weeks without a phone these days can you imagine .... and no one is taking ownership of the issue. I am thinking about going to consumer forum for the issue now. Phone is considered to be a emergency device now and I am without it for 4 weeks( still I do not have the mobile) ... I am completely at the mercy of the service center folks now .... Guys if you wanna risk your money experimenting about the mobile then go for it otherwise I suggest that buy some other phone whivh has good network of service centres in the country.",

            "comment": "I got it on exchange for nokia asha 206 an year old bought from flipkart an year ago. As soon as i got the box i found out: 1. phone looks sleek and amazing. 2. black fone, white charger and handsfree...what a turn off and NO DATA CABLE. 3. It MOTO and start off was amazing. So there is no menu button it ok...its not samsung...and no camera button phone's fast and amazing. Google support is great. No file manager...but thats the first thing that i got from google play. SO HERE IS THE ACTUAL REVIEW AFTER 1 MONTH'S USE Pros: 10k after giving my old non smart fone, for such an amazing phone kudos flipkart. phone is fast, good graphic support 5 inch screen wow. decent audio op good camera and hd video resolution...good video op its light weighted, fits in my pocket looks classy the back cover is rubber coating i think..gives a good grip for sweaty hands while playing games on the run. google gives me all the updates in one page, date time, cricket score, football updates, news, My location, mode of transport available from my current location to my home, my work schedule also tells me when im getting off from work \"Time to go home\" message comes up!!! :) YES ON ONE PAGE!!!! moto assist helps me a lot. Phone goes on silent automatically if i program it to go off daily at a particular time and vice a versa. and many other features... AND so much memory omg...my phone has 197 apps and games i still have 110gb internal memory left with my 16 gb memcard full of movies and cartoons and other stuffs. cons: Battery is a suck up..drains out faster. I multitask on the phone...play temple run while listening to music and 3g connected...hardly stays up for 4 hours straight.but thanks to power bank IM HAPPY There is no timer on camera. I like clicking picks and i sort of find it irritating. sometimes hangs...but its android...its bound to happen. sometimes...rarely...the fone heats up...i can make omlettes on the mobile cheap earphones...so i use zagg. phone hangs sometimes when i connect to wifi. I have a samsung s4, blackberry, iphone 4s and lumia720. I'll say...MOTO G2 is a gamer's delight..",

One phone is okay even though did not meet the expectation However I had the worst experience with Flipkart The phone started loosing network conectivity and raised a complaint against it. It took 1 month to days to resolve the issue. Customer support people told that the phone will be replaced on or before 29th October 2014. I got this information on 18th October 2014. I had to format the defect piece and keep it ready for pickup. DID NOT KNOW WHEN WILL THEY PICK UP. I did not have a phone till then. On 29th 12.44 PM, I got a message saying your product has been dispatched for delivery. 12.45 PM i got another message saying you rejected the product.!@#$ Again started battling with Flipkart. Then finally November 10, 2014 they sent me another phone to replace, a defect piece. I could not here anything but the called at the other end could here me. Same time voice for media was working correctly. Again started interacting with customer support. Finally yesterday that is 14th November 2014 they took the product back and I have to wait for my refund now. Also I need to search for another phone. From the day I choose to buy a phone in Flipkart, I am just like a person without mobile. The issues in the phone was: 1. Network drop. Even on of my relative bought Moto E where he is also having the same issue. 2. Extream heat generated. Especially when you use internet or camera 3. Camera is average 4. Voice disturbance during calls. Completely disappointed with Flipkart. Goodbye Flipkart.",

Now coming to its pros and cons: pros: -Nice price range -Premium looks -Good solid body with gorilla glass 3 which is almost scratchless -5 inch screen -phone is water resistant (it can endure everyday water splashes and we can also easily talk in rain) -Very smooth -Vanilla android experience and will get an update to Android Lollipop -Rear camera is good in low light conditions also -Battery life is good. Lasts me a day with normal to heavy usage. -Stereo speakers are great and loud Cons -Ram is just 1GB so when I'm playing heavy games and I come out of the game and go back to it, the game restarts -sometimes due to ram the launcher also restarts. but it takes only 1/2 a sec to restart so its not a big issue -front camera is not that good In the end I would suggest that you should go and buy this product if you have a range between 10-15k. According to its price range the product is good enough.",

OK coming to the review.I owned MOTO G 1st gen.It was awsome for its price.Still good deal for the price 9999. Advantages of MOTO G Good display (great display for the price),same for camera(since 5mp details are low but color reproduction is gr8),good sound(even its mono back speaker i find it loud and clear than moto g2) Advantages of MOTO G2 Great display compared to moto g(i found color tone of MOTO G2 is warm and MOTO g is cool) Gr8 camera 8 mp serves its purpose(more details than moto g and far better ) Gr8 design and feel,feels slimmer and lighter than moto g(even though by specs its slighly thicker and heavier) about graphics and all....its mid range snapdragon 400 powered device...but no lags and issues...far better than samsung and all phones upto 25k price range can play almost all games...for heavy gamers go for moto x. Disadvantages of moto G I say its speaker quality poor....very poor(even though more instrument music is audible its still far behind moto g So in simple for guys looking for new phone in price range 10k to 30k 1.usage moderate gaming and lots of social media normal day to day camera usage this is the phone 2.Heavy gamer more techy? wait for MI4. Moto x? still wait...i expect price to be drop soon...right price be 26k ...32k for 10.7gb useable memory ? (why? a phone with 5.2 screen ..u might watch and store lots of hd videos and play heavy games with about 1.5+ gb size,its not sufficient",

            "comment": "Great phone. By great I want to mean that within Rs.13000/- it gives all the feature of premium mobile. One thing I have noticed that the form factor of the phone is a bit different from my Galaxy Grand Duos (1st Gen). In portrait position horizontal screen size is less than Galaxy Grand. This is an added benefit for people with small hand. One-handed operation is very easy due to that form factor. I don't find any of the cones described in 1, 2 & 3 stared rating. Let me address some of them below: 1. SIM tray is not accurate in size : In reality, this is not an issue. If you cut down your standard SIM into MicroSIM then only this issue may arise. Because, MicroSIM is not exactly equal to a sized-down standard SIM. 2. Heating Problem : This is the law of physics not an issue. The actual heating part of the phone is processor not the battery. It happens in every electronic device. 3. Volume Rocker : Does not find any issue till now. It up/down volume 5 steps at a time. For instance, to increment/decrement volume from 0% to 100% one have to press 20 times or hold down the button. This is not an issue. This is the technology which provides more control in volume adjustment. 4. Mobile Internet : Please ask your network provider for better services. I have Aircel internet connection and didn't face a single problem. It automatically switches between 3G and 2G network based on coverage. 5. Memory Card : I am using Samsung MicroSDHC 32 GB Class 10 Evo memory card from the very beginning and yet to face any problem. This memory card is full of songs, movies and other things that can be played. (Did you remember the add. of Phillips DVD Player - \"Player anything round and flat\") There is only one cone I have noticed so far that the charging time is higher than my Galaxy Grand Duos. This is only because of the charger's capacity. A charger with higher output can fix this problem. Bottom Line : If you are expecting the WOW features of a 50000/- mobiles in a 13000/- mobile ... then I must admit that \"You are a dreamer\"",

How every it will not give you experience of high smartphones. Interface to settings is not that good but ok. It is same like other android phones. Its comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 that is some good of it. Video Recording is Not Full HD that is very huge lack in world of All high definition and front facing camera is 2 MP not that good for selfie. Back panel looks good in terms of design but lacks in quality of strength because it may get broken in opening. Front View of mobile doesn't give you any sense about up or down side, Front view is not nice as compare to back side, it seems as contradiction in designs. mobile has good sound quality when your singly watching videos. If u want to get just smartphone experience its ok...but not high end quality.",

Below are the list of problems that I've encountered. 3G will not auto connect if no WiFi available until restart or rebooting the device. This is a major problem and I think it's a glitch with 2nd Generation. Performance issues with the battery as it drains so fast even if you turn off GPS locations and other apps that chew battery. Reducing volume (by pressing down side button) will lead to delay the volume for 10 secs as it will not happens immediately. Due to the performance issues, device freeze for particular period unless you terminate applications. Even I've checked the RAM which is all clean with much space. Finally, requested to replace but the new device has got similar issues even thought few were resolved. Buyers - I would recommend to go for 1st Generation rather 2nd one. Cheers, Trinadh,",

But Thanks Flipkart for the day. About Flipkart: This time not-so-fast delivery. But, as I bought it on the Big Billion Day, I can understand the reason. About the Device: Pros: 1. Sleek build. 2. Feels of a great quality in-hand. Though not in metal. 3. Great quality speaker. 4. Very good display. 5. Fast processor. 6. Good call quality. 7. Great camera. Cons: 1. Ir-replaceable Battery. 2. Need to open back cover to insert Micro-SD or SIM card. 3. I don't know why, but I get only around 750-800 MB of total RAM. out of which 400-500 MBis always in use. This was the condition when it was new and I didn't install any app. If Android is using reserve memory, then I should be getting the remaining memory free, but still it is used up.",

Don't recommend such a bad build quality product. Even if you put some safe covers it looks bulky as it is already bulky. If you see the display in sun light you could see only the vertical lines in the screen nothing other than that, which is irritating. finally throwed my mobile and searching for some other mobile.",

Moto G 2nd gen is very nice and the product satisfies all our basic needs, right from capturing a nice pic to online payments and long calls. The camera is good, the storage is enough, the performance of the phone is fast for the RAM it has. Its not getting heated up after prolong use, the charge lasts long inspite of keeping 3G on for a long time and browsing the internet. The speakers are not up to the mark, same with the ear phones provided. The ear phones are not the one which you can insert in your ears, which lacks the rubber ring, which would have been better if provided. when wearing and lying down, sure that the ear phones will drop, which is one point to be considered. The charger provided is a normal one, not the one suitable for USB charging. The over all rating is that, best buy for this price. Look out for days when discounts are there to save some amount.",

But the same is not the case with this phone. The given 2070 mAh doesnt even get me through half a day . It hardly lasts for 5 hours with just one hour of 3G usage. The worst part is that if I turn on 3G connectivity battery power drops dramatically quick and the worst of all happens when I plug in the mobile for charging battery power keeps dropping and it takes a hell lot of time to get full charge. Additionally the mobile is heating up while charging. I have to use my mobile very frugally if I had to make it last for more than 10 hours. But that is not why we all buy smartphones and that is not how it works. I really didnt imagine Motorola has built a very good specs with 8MP cam, expandable memory, large screen size , good internal memory and everything around a pathetic battery life. All these are not made good use of if the battery performance is so poor . Wake up Moto !! I would rather buy a new Moto E back again from flipkart instead of this one. Though the specs were low battery was more than decent .",

If you are switching from Samsung, as it has stock android, absence of some small but basic features like hiding unnecessary inbuilt icons, setting separate wallpapers for lock screen and home screens, no file explorer, no inbuilt navigation app etc. may annoy you initially. Use black wallpaper to save battery which may be concern to some buyers. (As per my observation it has significant impact on battery life to be honest). The in-box charger charges phone at quite good speed. If you are a nominal user of internet(3G) your battery may last more than 30 hours. If you are always streaming videos and are on phone for internet, it is not at all for you as you will feel that you are always out of charge. *It is difficult (rather impossible for me) to charge from PC/laptop using USB cable. It just doesn't work for me. So you may be needed to carry plug charger with you all the time. I did not buy it for camera, though taken pics still look great. In-box earphones are a bit disappointment, not par with the quality/features of phone, it just seems to be liability than a complementing feature. All in all I am giving 4 stars for other users who want to buy it.(performance + fair battery life - missing basic features - not so good earphones) However for me it comes to around 4.5 stars as I hardly miss Samsung features in it. I love its speed and display. Also I use 4-6 hours of internet daily, around 1-2 hours in office and 4-5 hours at my home, and the battery lasts for around 30 hours for me, so not much issue with battery life as well. Only issue is that it does not get charged by any USB cable (Motorola has not provided any in-box cable) so I need to carry charger with me all the time and provided earphones are bad quality earphones. (btw JBL earphones work great with this phone.)",

The camera performance is not great with the default Motorola camera, but does give an improved performance with third-party apps. The battery backup is decent enough for the price (it lasts about 1.5 days for average usage). The phone tends to heat up on continuous gaming for about 20 minutes or so.. And the worst aspect of this purchase is that Motorola packed an earphone which is just a piece of crap.... BUT THE DEVICE IS AWESOME. BEST BUDGET PHONE UNDER 15K.",

Have all updated features . Design is good. light weight. Easy to handle for a newbie. the phone is made up of good quality materials its 8mp camera is better than Sony. cons Don't expect a good service center at your home town ..as i m facing this problem in allahabad.If some major problem arise in future(Hope so don't happen) i have to send it to main service center of moto which will cost me 15-20 days without my phone.

            "comment": "The design: Nothing outstanding but the curved back do helps in gripping the phone. Screen: Good sun light legibility at 50% brightness levels Build quality: For a careless person like me this assumes prime importance. The phone has been dropped 2-3 with screen downwards on tarred roads. Nothing has happened to the screen only plastic has chipped from upper edges. Camera: Good camera. For all those complaining about poor camera. Enable touch focus and give camera sufficient time (2-3 seconds) to focus (Let the green colored circle appear before clicking). Cam has acceptable quality indoors. Battery: lasts 12-15 hours with my usage (2G internet, screen on 3-4 hours, 1-2 hours of calling, 1 hour of games like subway surfer, Sudoku etc.) Charging time: Default charger takes eternity to charge, heard slow charging is beneficial for battery life and only time will tell how long the battery lasts Do NOT compare it to phones like MI3 which are targeted at different segments. Mi3 has its own advantages but nothing can provide vanilla android experience at this price point. IMHO, user experience matters more than anything else. Hardcore android loyalists will appreciate Moto G (second gen) while the MiUi rom lovers will prefer Mi3. To each his own. P.S. Posting this review after 2 months of usage. Phone has hanged 2-3 times. If your phone is stuck, just press the power button for 7-10 seconds to bring it back to life",

            "comment": "Moto G review (2014): still the best budget smartphone Last year's Moto G took us all by surprise. Sure, we knew Motorola wanted to reinvent the cheap smartphone experience, but the very first device in the company's cost crusade was even better than we expected. Let's be honest, though: The G's greatest asset was its small, it became awfully easy to forgive the thing for not being the quickest, the prettiest or the smartest. Still, it was one of those gadgets that wound up being more than just \"good enough\"; between the price and performance, the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own, period. Here we are less than a year later, and we've got a sequel to play with (one with the same name, no less). If you took a quick peek at what it brings to the table, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Motorola wanted to play it safe the second time around -- the new Moto G2 isn't a game changer, and it doesn't have to be. Does this year's model clear the \"good enough\" bar once again? Moto G (2014) PROS Camera is much better than the original's Near-stock Android 4.4.4 is a treat Feels snappy despite aging internals Inexpensive CONS No LTE Screen isn't as crisp as last year's model SUMMARY Motorola's wallet-friendly formula hasn't changed much since last year's Moto G, but that's OK -- the company changed just enough to make the 2014 version one of the best budget smartphones out there.",

So very dissappointed by the build quality of motorola. Had to keep it because can't take a risk what if the other one came with more deffects. Cons :1. Poor Battery.. get drained itself even without using the phone.. upto rate of 3% per hour even on standby. 2.Speakers are not of good quality.. Sound is not very clear. 3.Mic is not also very good.. Sometime you have to repeat again and again to make the other party hear you. 4. Accessories with the phone are of no use.. cheap quality headphones.. even the charger is of very cheap quality. Accessories supplied with the phone likes samsung guru are more better. Phone is average. Had to go for this phone beacuse of not much option available in this price range",

Thank you very much Flipkart. highly appreciate ur customer service..",

The battery of this device is in-build , & It take almost 3 hours to charge completely, it should not take this much time to charge. 2. Some time Mobile gets warm slightly after charging & Use. But there are the general issue with all android device. so My opinion for this device is good. You can buy this . go for it . it is good for use.",

The built quality of phone is Awesome and its back is given with a Matt finish. 4. Amazing performance I didn't even noticed a lag while playing games even like Asphalt8, Nova, 5. The camera clarity was awesome with 8mp with flash and the front cam 2mp is very Good to make Vedio calls. GPS : GPS issue is solved in this mobile when compared to Moto G the G2 issue is solved and the GPS works well now. I Rate this mobile 5 star for sure.",

If you have a budget below 15k, this is the only phone that you should get. Don't fall for more cores, bigger RAM or higher GHz advertised by other companies, just go for this. The only thing missing in the phone is NFC, which I doubt anyone in India even uses, and if you have a use case for NFC, you're most likely not the target audience.

When i couldn't activate the offer, I got back to the customer care, who came back saying that the offer wasn't there when I placed t.he order This was a blatant and shameless lie. The information was provided to me over mail and not over a call, because they knew they were reneging. Going forward, I have learnt not to trust Flipkart with its offers.

            "comment": "Great phone for the price, nice feel, solid performance. As a 3 generation iphone user, I got tired of jailbreaks and work arounds. I was worried about performance and the camera. I had a short stint with a Nexus One that left me with a bit of a sour taste for Android so this was a big leap. The phone is fast, the only thing that seems to make it hang a bit are large web pages, jumping back to the home screen can take 1-2 seconds, but everything else seems as fast or faster than my iphone 5 with 7.1.2. Battery life is just as good as the iphone. The screen is amazing and the biggest surprise is the camera, the daytime photos are fantastic. Nighttime are slightly worse than the iphone but the day shots are just that much better. Overall a fantastic phone and a pleasure to use. This is one of those devices that is greater than the sum of its parts (or specs).",

            "comment": "First of all Thanks to flipkart delivery, it was awesome as usual . Now THE MOTO G 2nd GEN received it today . the moment when i opened the box, there was a big smile on my face, the looks killed me :D everything is good, the display, the sound quality of front speaker(by default they are set to bass punch so you might get disappointed with its so called \"fatti hui awaz\". you can adjust it) now come to the big question... \"THE BATTERY\" as i received it today.... battery backup i got was not so impressing we can say its just average, but Motorola claims that battery will give its maximum backup after 10-11 charges, as it is being calibrated within this time. LETS SEE. some people complained that phone is getting heated while charging but mine does not, heating can also be a reason of high/low voltage or etc. but yes battery takes time to charge because of its low Amp charger. . . Rest is awesome. thumbs up. just buy it.",

            "comment": "I got this product on Sep. Initially it was good.. but slowly i started experiencing problems.. Issues: 1. Dialer - Sometimes it will get stuck, finally i have to shutdown and restart. 2. Msg App - It do not support quick template msgs. So I had to look for alternative. 3. Battery- If you are using 3G/Wifi from morning 7 AM , ur phone will get shutdown at 7PM 4. USB Cable- U cannot transfer movies onto your mobile, it will get disconnect and reconnect in between (already tried with various data cables and also tried with diff mobiles with same data cable and sd card) 5. Games Crash- HD games will carsh after using for 1 ~ 1.5month or so.. if you tell this to moto cust care they will reply to uninstall and reinstall. I already address this issues.. They said to get in touch with service center (so soon) I got this phone in installment, now regretting... Good: Display: Excellent Camera: Nice photos Look: Good",

As coming to the battery backup by moderate gaming, listening music, and using WiFi or normal data it gives me 6 hours of battery backup. Though this could be eliminated by updating to Android L (lollipop) or using a Power Bank. Ultimately a best SmartPhone for SmartPeople.",

Because 13th November is our 1st Wedding Anniversary, I have chosen this mobile for my wife as a special gift. I open the package and see the phone it was good to see. But I am very disappointed when I was switch on the phone :(.. Yes touch panel was not working,. I raised request for replacement, they told me call back on another 24 hrs. I don't want to be delay on this..After 7hrs I am not getting any call from Flipkart and status was still processing. I am waiting. I don't want to get this product after 13th November.",

But as soon as I started installing the bare essential Apps, the phone's processing speed reduced drastically. It has only been a week & the Apps take a lot of time to load...even making phone calls looks to be painful task with the wait due to the slow speed. The Moto E which is much cheaper than the Moto G has a better & much faster processing speed. I would not recommend this product at all.",

The multitasking was too good and fluent. Phone doesn\u2019t lags while playing games (but it heats).with moderate use of 3G , Wifi the juice lasts upto 15 hrs . But after updating my phone to lollipop 5.0.2 . the performance of my device started decreasing and so as the battery life. Many apps which was crashing every now &then was fixed by subsequent updates . But the performance parameter of the phone goes on decreasing, phone lags and become unresponsive (and then for a moment you think 1Gb ram is not sufficient). The front shooter of the device is ok for all your videos calls and selfie but the images from the rear shooter are quite dull and lacks smoothness .The dual firing speakers provide decent sound quality and are quite loud. But the chrome bars used in speakers attract and traps dirt and dust .Battery performance goes on decreasing day by day ,now after 7 months my battery last only for 6 hours with wifi and 3G on whereas it takes 4 hours to charge using motorola charger .Overall design Quality is good and ergonomic ,this phone can be well operated by single hand . I would recommend not to waste money in this phone because there are lots of cheaper and better options are available in the market with 4G , and 2GB ram options .",

The most advantageous thing about Motorola is you get the latest android version. So here are some Pros and Cons of Moto G (2nd Gen) Pros: 1. Expandable Memory: which is best according to me because my Moto X doesn't have this feature 2.Corning Gorilla Glass 3 : but not as durable as Moto X screen is delicate 3 Camera :8 MP Rear Camera 2 MP Front Camera which is feasible according to the price 4. \u20221.2 Ghz Qualcomm Quad Core Processor which is an essential thing Cons: Display: It has IPS LED display but when you see the screen from the side it goes greenish this doesn't happen to OLED display Sometimes phone gets heated due to multiprocessing One of my friend got faulty battery indicator , after charging the phone to 100% within 5-10 minutes it goes down to 75% but issue got fixed by Motorola. In conclusion the phone is worth buying for the price range of 10-15k !!!!",

I predicted that the lot itself might have this issue and raised a return request again. To my surprise, customer care advisor asked me to go to service centre of motorola. Man why should I carry your non-working device to service centre for repair? Then this guy asked me to reset the device and rejected my request of return.

They ask to reset the phone for HW problem!!! The technical team can only call at their predefined time and if you miss 1-2 times then thats it... you need fix another appointment with them. Even meeting PM may be easier than talking to Flipkart technical support people. Even after telling the proper address they ship to wrong address and comes back and tell you have given wrong address. Finally after a hell lot of struggle they gave a new phone which is to my surprise the speaker doesn't work!!! Again the same round of dealing with tech support. Finally requested for refund. All this took more than a month since there was stock shortage during the time. Along with the phone I purchased a flip cover too, now when I asked why don't you take it since this is of no use for me and refund money since you have given non working product, Flipkart people are very adamant that they can't do anything and you deal with it!!! Flipkart is not going to help customers and its going to be history soon I think...",

I have had few of my friends having similar issues as well. Excruciatingly annoying when i want to make a call or receive an important message and network isnt there. What's the point of having good specs when the phone does't catch the cellular network required for phone call, message / internet browsing. I suggest to go for other phones with good connectivity. There are loads of models available in market at the same price with same or better specs / features and connectivity.",

It has a decent processor, good display and an good camera in class. The biggest drop back I found that Moto doesn't provide USB cable to connect with system. That we need to buy from separately. I used this phone for almost a month and I feel it is perfect replacement of iPhone (some feature I still miss in android). Its really a value for money and must to have phone under 11k.",

But found that they have pretty good number of service centres in my city atleast. As far as the product is concerned, it works very well with great display and features. I also got Android lollipop pre-loaded on the phone. I sometimes feel that a 2GB RAM would have been an icing on the cake but nevertheless it works fantastically. I have also downloaded a few heavy games and they also run fine except that the phone responds a little slower but only for a few seconds. Overall highly satisfied.

As of now, I am happy with the way with the product looks, the efficient performance and the long battery life. I use a lot of apps on the phone, including a fair number of business apps. It's too quick to do a full review, but the phone functions well without a lag even when switching between different programs. I like the fact that Moto has not fiddled much with the Android OS, which translates to a much smoother functioning and user experience. I have been using the phone non-stop since I received it, and as of now, I am very happy with the product. I can do a detailed review a month later. Looks wise, the screen is pretty big; I would have preferred it to be sleeker though. I bought the white version and I will be buying a couple of Moto back covers soon to change the look as and when I get bored.",

The return request was rejected twice for no reason. After constant follow-ups and running pillar to post the return request was approved yesterday. It is mentioned that the replacement will be delivered on 6th-July So after paying the full money and extra bucks for fast delivery, I am left with no functional phone for 16 days. I am not sure what if the replacement phone also not works. This agonizing experience with Flipkart has shattered my faith this brand name. Seems we as a customer are just money payers holding no value for Flipkart. I can say that this was my last shopping on Flipkart and in future I will refrain from dealing with Flipkart. Now that there are better and bigger Brands providing better services and customer satisfaction, I will go for them to avoid any such painful experience. I felt Like CHEATED by Flipkart....!!!!!",

If you get more calls then, its has to be always kept plugged in. With this phone you get 0.5A charger which takes 6-8 hrs to fully charge the phone. what is like in this phone is just the slim look and the latest version. Waste of money!",

Across phones, including Moto G 2nd gen, the perpetual problem is that despite the claims of a Gorilla 3 screen, all the screens are extremely fragile. The replacement of screens is prohibitively expensive (E.g. Moto X 1st gen screen replacement is Rs 12,540/-). Worst part is that their service centers are NOIT Motorola dedicated ones - they use shared service centers that also cater to many Cheap Chinese brands. If you wrote to the company, no one cares, you call them, no one listens! NOT really a value for money phone. No point buying a phone and repenting in 1 month. ANYONE AT MOTOROLA LISTENING? (NB: If I hear from Motorola, I'll update this positively. In past, I even made a SVP from Motorola USA to write to Indian execs but no one cared to respond!)",

The response form the flipkart is very poor and asked me to visit near service center which is 30kms from my place. From them i started making rounds around the service center with various problems. I can suggest good mobiles are available in market other than this where they can have more service centers near to their home. unfortunately now also I am using the same moble as i am not able to spend more money on buying other worst mobile on flipkart.

If you want to compromise with features according to price then this the best choice. Also I want to mention here that Moto G(2nd Gen) design and quality is very nice.

Bought this in 3 different prices: Feb 2015 - Rs.13000 Mar 2015 - Rs.10000 (incl of Flipkart App big day discount and 10% discount on AXIS card) June 2015 - Rs.9000 (incl of Flipkart App big day discount and 10% discount on SBI card) Pros: Not to be listed. I see tonnes of Pros in this Phone. Some which haven't been mentioned by other reviewers I would like to share it: 1. Service is very good. If your product is within warranty you are 100% secured with zero penny wasted. 2. Accessories are damn cheap (ex: Charger - Rs.350, Earphones - Rs.250) Cons: 1. If phone switched off with dry battery, it takes minimum 15 mins to gain 1% battery. Total charging time to gain full battery is also too too slow (but battery back up is very good compared to other smartphones with 16M colors) Verdict: GO GO GO..!!!!!! Buy this and enjoy rest of your time..!!!! WSRetail and Flipkart Rocks in their service by prompt delivery..!!!!!",

Now my findings are: Cons: 1- Battery percentage not displayed in status bar. 2- To enable mobile data we have to click simultaneously 3 times from toggle quick settings to settings. 3 - Issue with battery. Takes too much time to charge, almost 4 hours. 4 - Battery drops down inconsistently. Again reverts to old percentage on restart. 5 - Many bugs on software. 6 - Snapdragon 400 is old nowadays. Snapdragon 410 on other phones such as Lenovo A6000, Lenovo A6000 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi 2, Honor 4X works much better. 7- Heats up sometimes a little on gaming and video calling. 8 - No \"clear all\" function in task switcher. Pros 1 - Amazing built quality 2 - OS updates. The best feature of all. 3 - Brand Name. 4 - Excellent customer support and service center. Go for this device if the above cons suits you. About Flipkart. Excellent service. Very prompt and fast delivery. Awesome packaging. VERY easy returns. Super excellent customer service. Always purchase from Flipkart. They are the best. Don't look elsewhere...",

Thanks to the 3 day offer by flipkart on June 22-24, I got my hands on this phone for just 7000 in exchange offer. So far the phone has satisfied all my needs. The packing by Flipkart was good and neat and my phone was delivered without any defect or mistake. Good things about Moto G: 1. The display is good and classy. Doesn't look cheap at all. Gives a premium look 2. The performance of the phone is good under normal usage. Apps open quickly without any lag. I have not played any games yet so can't comment on the performance with respect to games 3. Automatic brightness is available which is a good thing. We don't have to adjust the brightness every time. Sunlight viewing is also comfortable. I did not find any issues with it. 4. The build quality matched my expectations. It looks similar to Nexus series of phones( i compared my phone with the nexus phones that my colleagues had, and found no difference in the build quality) 5. The battery is not draining on standby. I left the phone at 65% when I went to bed, and the next morning the charge was 64%. This was impressive. The battery also lasts for upto one and half days on moderate usage( whatsapp - 1-2 hours, checking facebook 2-3 times a day, browsing internet for 1 hour, voice calls- 1 hour, video play back - 1 hour, using camera for 15-20 min ) 6. The front stereo speakers are really good and it impressed me a lot. I liked listening to few songs on the speakers 7. The camera clarity was good. The HDR mode makes the photos look brighter and clearer. There was no shutter lag. 8. 16 GB memory 9. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Things I didn't like about Moto G: 1. The headphones that come in box are not good. They are below average 2. The call quality could have been better. Though i kept the call volume at maximum, i still had trouble listening to the voice on the other side. The voice is not clear on calls. 3. No file manager app. I don't mind the cons that much. Overall, i love the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a budget phone with good quality. Full 5 stars for the phone",

But till date my handset is lying with the service center only. Motorola office is telling that they have sent the parts and the handset is repaired but till date i have not received back my handset.

It gets heated up very much when net is running and when I am attending a call simuatneously. The battery life is normal though its not giving according to expectation. The pictures shot by its camera is good but when its copied to PC and seen , gives not good quality of pics as compared to samsung android phones. Just after 1 month of using the phone it got heated up in such an extent that it was giving me a smell of burning PCB. Recently I have reported a problem that sometime when a call is comming I cant pick it up as the touck to receive a call is not working . Overall the experience is average .",

Have requested return. Surprised to know about the torturous return policy at flip kart. One customer service representative informs me that unless the diagnostic app is installed, no replacement possible. I try my best to them understand that because the phone's touchscreen is not working properly i am unable to install the app. Finally another customer service representative informs that it need to be taken to nearest flip kart repair center. After the certification from the technical service center the phone may be replaced. So i need to take the phone to the service center,get report from them, scan and email the report to flip kart. Why so much troubles for customers already suffering a loss of their time, money and the inconvenience caused by a defective productive? By the called motorola mobility service center, which recommended me a replacement. Its the flip kart that is causing problems! Buyers beware!!",

Dual Sim Works perfect with this phone. Superb Network capturing even at the places where network is sporadic. No Heating problems at all, only thing is Motorola should increase the RAM of this mobile to at least 2 GB for advance users those usually use more applications and games. I know 1GB RAM is suffice the need of general users but new application those are coming now days requires more RAM to operate them seamlessly, else i would say Moto G stands apart from crowd, that's the reason behind its huge success. keep it up Motorola.

            "comment": "My previous three smartphones have all been HTC Android devices. I decided to try the Moto G (2gen) after seeing Moto G and Moto X with friends. I had the following requirements: * Android Lollipop * Sufficient internal storage to let me install lots of apps (my previous phone had just 4 GB, which was not enough) * dual SIM I also wanted a phone, not a phablet. I would be very reluctant to go for a 5.5\" screen, for instance. The Moto G is great. Call quality, data connectivity, wifi reliability, are all very good. (My last phone, the HTC Desire 600, used to drop wifi randomly and repeatedly.) The 16 GB internal storage gives me more than 12 GB free after system software and bundled apps. This is more than enough for lots of apps. Unlike the 1gen device, this one has a MicroSD slot, which allows for a lot of the apps and data to be moved to the SD card. I don't get any HTC enhancements to the UI -- I get just stock Lollipop here. But I am finding it quite usable. Some things don't work as expected, but they are Lollipop problems. I should not dwell on them in a phone review. I also bought a Motorola flip cover for the phone, which replaces the back cover and fits on the body very well. I love this cover, because opening the flip-top switches on the screen without me having to hit the power button. Very nice touch. (I used to keep switching on the screen just to check the time, since my cellphone has been my watch for the last few years.) I will highly recommend this accessory. Have not used the supplied headset, so I can't comment on its quality. I have used the headset output with my Etymotic HF2 and ER4-PT IEMs and the sound quality is excellent -- it's all you can expect without a dedicated headphone amp. Adequate volume too. The Bluetooth pairing with my Plantronics Voyager Legend is very solid -- I don't find Bluetooth pairing drop-outs as I used to find occasionally with my HTC. I have done upto two hour-long tele-conferences using GoToMeeting and Skype using this phone and my Voyager Legend, with the phone online on 3G. It works well. Am not a gamer, so I can't comment on game performance. I find it hard to justify the price of an expensive HTC 826 after experiencing this phone.",

Before I forget, motorola migrate is an excellent utility, it transferred all the data / apps / contacts et from my samsung note to moto g2, it was so convenient that I did not find a single inconvenience switching to a new phone. My recommendation, is go for it. Only down side I find is using the dual sim. When one sim is being used the other sim callers get out of coverage message. Other than this, all is good.",

Heating Issue. c. The accessory headphone will stop working if not handled with care. d. Service centres are not approachable over phone e. The battery doesn't lasts more than 8 hrs if fully charged.

            "comment": "Hello there, I'm a 17 year old boy who bought this phone recently and so this is my honest review for this phone. There are many pros for this phone which you might've already seen in other reviews, so I'm gonna list some important cons about this phone.. . . 1). Battery - Honestly, this is the worst battery backup I've seen on any phone till date. But so they totally depend on one's usage. If you play some heavy games and play some music then browse for about an hour and then check Youtube you might get disappointed as you might've to charge it twice a day! But the same phone if my father uses he gets around 60% backup remaining after a full day usage. His usage is like, he frequently make or attend calls then if got some free time checks WhatsApp or Facebook, this is his full day usage! So, it might be or might not be a deal breaker for some. . . 2). Charger - Again, the battery takes too much time to charge with its default charger. It takes around 7-8 hours for me to charge it from 15% to 100% as the output is only 0.5 Amp. But if you change your charger having an Output of 1 Amp. then it'll charge in approximately 1 hour 30 minutes. But don't risk your phone by buying some Chinese charger, do buy some branded charger. And yes the charger does not have a detachable cable which could work as a Micro-USB cable for your PC. So, buy separately a Micro-USB cable. . . 3). Lollipop - This is not the problem with phone but with its Software. The UI is slightly sluggish. It does'nt mean it hangs a lot, you'll rarely see some lag on it. The latest update by Google which is installed on this phone is Lollipop v5.0.2. Users who bought this phone with Kitkat said the phone was buttery smooth before installing the Lollipop update. Even the issue with Battery Backup is because of Lollipop as Google officially said it and so Google released Lollipop 5.1 which have many improvements including battery backup. Motorola has confirmed the Lollipop 5.1 update for Moto G (2nd Generation) and other Moto phones but there is no official wording on release date. . . These are some important cons about this phone worth to be mentioned. But don't forget there are many pros as well which might be pleasing for many, like me! If you think that these cons are deal breaker for you then I'll suggest you to go for ASUS Zenfone 2 and if you don't have any problem with chinese brands, then do check Xiaomi Mi4i. Again they've their own cons so choose wisely!",

Its feels as if this phone is handcrafted only for you..!! Coming to the specs.. 1.2 ghz speed seems to be slow but trust me you can play high end games such as Asphalt 8 or soo.. battery draining fast is an issue..but as it says nothing is perfect in this world..!! Camera is too awesome..!! With 8mp and 2mp it captures super images.!!! Coming to Display....display is good but not best..!! Smudges are often on the screen Sound quality is brilliant with dual speaker front camera..!! The back cover feels really smooth and gr8 to hold it your hand..!! The best part of this phone is it comes with an expandable memory..!! Which is gr8 and that mi4i doesn't provide..!!! If your budget is between 10-12 you must blindly go for this..!!Even after sales-service is also fantastic..!! There is a pre- loaded app in every moto phone where we connect with the customer care..!! As this one is just made for you and would definitely impress you..!!! Review written after 3-4 months of use...!!",

TAKES TIME TO OPEN APPLICATIONS AND WHILE DIALING IT TAKES TIME. WHILE WATCHING VIDEOS THE SCREEN QUALITY VERY POOR. FORGET ABOUT HD QUALITY NORMAL QUALITY ALSO NOT THERE WHILE COMPARE TO OTHER PHONES. OVER ALL I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE.

Battery design by motorola is very bad it discharge with in 5-6 hr. use in ( 2 sim+ wi-fi+map+mail+etc. ) So I suggest for who buying new phone at the range between 11-15k. I suggest you go through the redmii MI4i. nice battery. 1.7ghz processor for gaming, 3110mah battery. 16 GB internal storage. compare to motorola i suggest mi4i is nice&budget phone. And I request Motorola please design the battery of mobile phone according to its performance & daily use of phone.",

But the major issue I observe is that there is no permanent setting for 2G only or 3G only network mode. Keep on switching a lot. Major issue with the high data users.

Quiet impressed with UI and playstore and repented for not being moved to android that long. This Moto G 2 generation is the 4th phone in my house from same moto family, since they are always reliable, less priced with high specs and very easy with UI.

Just coz specs dont matter a lot. This is a ridiculously fast phone and that is because it runs stock android with just a few motorola additions. Overall it is a very good phone. As of now there is a bit competition in the market wih phones like Mi3, Mi4i, Asus Zenfone 5, Asus Zenfone 2, etc. but as per my thinking Moto G is a lot lot better than those. The feel in the hand is awesomeee :) The audio quality is the best at this price point via the front facing stereo speakers. I wished the speakers to be less wider and black in colour but still okk... I loved the slow motion recording from the rear 8 MP Camera and the camera shutter speed is also gud... Well i found out that the battery lasted quite well with heavy usage it gave me about 5 to 6 hours of battery backup. If you are a normal user then it will easily last you a full day (before 9 pm in night according to my test) but still its gud as u can plug in a charger at night.....

Many apps get closed (Google Chrome,etc). 2) Takes 4 hrs to charge. 3) Battery of 2070 mAh not enough for 5 inch Screen. Hence Battery Sucks. 4) with Single Sim it works properly. But when i start using with Dual sim. Network comes and go every time. when i start internet in Sim1 than Sim2 Becomes emergency and vice-versa. 5) with 3G net it will drain in 3.5 hours and will take another 4 hours to full charge 6) Heats many times (FYI - never played single game or ran any heavy application) 7) Charge was getting heat up like a sun. than replaced it on Motorola Service center. But still its heating. 8) During call, its getting over heated. Pro: 1) Camera is Good. 2) Very smooth, never gets Hang 3) Light and Good Looking 4) On Stand by Battery is very Good (Kudos All batteries are Good at Stand By ) 5) Call quality is very good 6) Front speaker is one good idea.

            "comment": "Dear all, This was my first purchase of smart phone and i chose Flipkart as they always ensure timely delivery of items wherever we are. I ordered this phone on 29th May 2015 and got exactly on 12th June 2015. I was worrying as my working place is near by a small village called Balipara in Assam but Flipkart did a wonderful job, and it surprised most of my colleagues as the place is away from town and we thought that the delivery would be time consuming. Though i have already Microsoft Lumia 630 phone, i was in dilemma to choose whether lumia or any android devices and finally selected moto g 2nd generation as very a few of my friends have been using the same and are satisfied with its performance. Just a week got over after its use i cannot give much points about it but some points would like to share so that new customers can easily select this smart phone. Positive: 1. Look and body 2. Connectivity 3. User friendly 4. Simple settings 5. Rich android experience 6. Trendy look 7. Easy to handle 8. Affordable price 9. Good memory 10. Rich video experience 11. Easy navigation and good wifi connectivity 12. Excellent games display. Negative: 1. The screen resolution needs to be improved under sun light as it is not up to the mark. 2. Bit heavy comparing with my Lumia phone. Purchase only through flipkart as the item is good and safe packing. Thanks & Regards, C.S.Shankar",

It was special discount on that day. Thanks to flipkart for such an awesome discount and very quick delivery of phone within just 2-3 days. Pros: 1) Very nice look, Classic look 2) Speakers are good, Voice quality is better, Internet browsing speed is also good 3) Internal storage is 16 GB...SO no need of SD card. though you want it has a memory card slot also. Cons: 1) hanging issue sometimes...need to lock and unlock it to resolve issue or switch off. Overall a good smart phone in this budget by MOTOROLA.",

Now discussing about the phone i would like to say that this is a honest review on the basis of 3 weeks of usage and what i have observed. Instead of giving pros and cons i would like to describe the features of the phone Camera : The asset of this product is the camera feature. 8 MP Camera provides good clarity. The example of a good picture was i took a snap of my laptop screen and each and every word of the mail open on the screen was easily and clearly viewable. Front camera is quite satisfactory and good for video calls if you are interested. There are extra features like HD quality image and manual focus Cons : There are not many edit features in the camera itself. Rating : 8.5/10 Battery : Many users are saying this is a big issue since the battery drains very quickly. No need to worry at all because if you handle the phone fruitfully and sensibly you will able to save a lot of battery(Refer to the different battery saving methods). Besides the phone itself provides a battery saver option in battery settings which saves a lot of energy. Cons : Heavy use may reduce battery life. If you are a fan of gaming dont go for it. Games drain the battery a lot. Browsing in 2G and some basic apps like Whatsapp, facebook and messenger will give you a minimum of 12-14 hours of backup provided you follow the battery saving instructions 6/10 Speed : Very good. Easy multitasking and the phone will provide the latest updated lolypop android which never causes any hang now. 7.5/10 Sound : Average. Only the basic Moto tune is loud else you to download custom ringtones. Speakers are good 7/10 Video : Excellent. I have seen videos and its showing without any lag and crystal clear resolution. 9/10 Additional Features(along with overall pros and cons) Look and fill : The phone is slim and very stylish. Its also hardy providing a gorilla glass screen which protects you from basic scratches. I have dropped my phone already two times and its safe till now :D However its good to a have a screen guard and back cover for safety 9/10 Pros 1. The biggest feature is the ready updates that are provided. 2. The phone is very user friendly and easy to handle 3. Camera is very good in respect to 8 mp Cons 1. Battery life in case you are a heavy user and a gamer (6 hours max) 2. The phone does not provide USB charger. You have to have a USB cable in case you want to transfers file and songs You can trust and go ahead :) Overall review - 8/10",

But then somehow i got convince and bought it. 1. It was having offer at that time ,so i got a free genuine motog2 flip cover. 2. It's been 5 months since then and the phone is working like butter. Never got hung. NEVER!! 3.It had an issue of battery which only used to last 1 day on a single charge. But after the lollipop update it has become a little better. Still satisfactory but not so good. 4.Processor is too good`since it is quad core,and different apps works simultaneously without any lag. 5.You can play Asphalt(1.6gb) and minimize it at any time and do some other task and get back to the game later and it will all work very fine. Smooth!! 6.Camera is damn good. Front camera is just good. Lags if running on low storage. 7.Phone's storage is too good 12 gb for all your apps. Sound quality is good too. 8.STURDY!! Have fallen twice ,but nothing happens to the screen. 9. Last but not the least, for the price it is available now in the market is sure is a good offer for any buyer. You can update it to Lollipop as soon as you buy it.",

The good thing is calling is really better than any smartphone by any means. and camera is really good. All in all its a hard handy phone with average look One more thing black one is better looking than the white one,as i am using the later",

            "comment": "I'm posting this review after using Moto G2 for two months now. Order booking process to delivery from Flipkart was on time as always (5 Stars to Flipkart). After an initial week of usage, this phone had started creating all sorts of issue possible in a mobile phone. List is below - 1. Display screen has gone permanently blurry 2. SD card is never readable on this device 3. Forgets to detect sim card too occassionally 4. Phone lags too much on multiple operations 5. And biggest of all problems is the Motorolla service centre (Thane west). This service centre handles multiple brands of phone (not a motorolla store). After explaining my problem the solution that I got was pathetic. Just to get this device checked which is under warranty, I have to pay 400 Rs. on top of that it will take about 12 days for them to get back with the reason for the problems. I consider this store as fraud, they will tell me false reasons about the cause. (I requested them to inspect in front of me, which they denied) Request everyone buying a phone is to first check Service centre availability and process. Most companies (Even international) nowadays launch cheap quality products in India without any service. I request Flipkart to help me with the return of this product to manufacturer if possible and exchange my device.",

Opened it up. Brand new-looking phone. Awesome. Turn it on, swipe the screen out of joy, see \"waves\" form at the middle of the screen, from top to bottom, in the center of the screen. Considered normal behaviour I assumed, so I let it slide. The three hardware buttons seemed to be working correctly as well. 15 days later, I did some research on the \"waves\" I saw on-screen on the first day, find out that it usually takes a LOT MORE force than what I applied for that to happen. That's strike one. Strike two, the volume down button already seems to be sinking into the body. What the hell? Normally unheard-of issue. Strike three would be the flicker when the phone is used at the lowest possible brightness level. Plain weird display, I suspect faulty. Also important is the fact that the display fails to register touch inputs at times, which is EXTREMELY worrying for a full-touch device. Thankfully I bought the phone from WS Retail, which has the Flipkart advantage guarantee, and it's only been about 2 weeks since I've been using this phone. Slightly disappointing, I've requested for a replacement a second time (First one was understandably cancelled since I failed to respond to calls the first time I noticed these issues.) Will update my experience as I go.",

Better life in 12 hours in 3G, which is also not exceptionally good i feel. RAM performance i can really feel the difference from my 2GB Xiomi MI3, it will remind you 'ohh I am just 1 GB dont overburden me' whenever you start 3 more apps with facebook.

The reason is simple - that there are only 3 service centres for Motorola mobile phones in Bangalore - time for any problem takes 2 months and the service quality is bad. I gave the phone for service to correct the faulty charging pin, but in return got a free problem of my touch screen not working intermittently. 2)The resolution of the phone is not upto the mark. 3)The touch screen is very fragile. A simple hit can cause the touch screen getting broken. So please check with your friends who has a moto phone before buying - on the quality, and service(of course poor quality, u simply walk in to one of their service center to see the long queues and the hassle)",

The size isn't too big, as some people may feel. It fits comfortably in my palm (Who knows, I have big hands). The touch is responsive and even though the 1 GB RAM seems less, it supports all apps and doesn't lag (I don't play too many games). The camera is excellent, though some heating problems are there on prolonged usage, but that is to be expected. The dual stereo speakers were a surprise. I expected one to be a speaker and another the receiver. Don't expect the speakers to play HD Audio. There's some static heard when the speaker mode is ON. The biggest drawback is the phone facility (IRONY). The loudspeaker and handset modes have almost same volume when full. Whether you need a phone for a short time before upgrading to a flagship model or you're buying it as someone's first mid-range phone, this is the best choice. At Rs. 10,999, it is the best option among it's peers. I use it and I'm happy.",

When i approached the Service Center, i was informed that they already have such Phones with them in abundance and that the Battery cannot be replaced without an approval (I don't know from whom). There isn't any definite answer as to if you would get the Product replaced or that the Battery gets replaced. Kindly opt for another Mobile and save yourself the Hassle. 10,999 down the drain.",

I will never buy a single product from flipkart neither i will recommend you guys to any of my friend. Let me tell you this glamorous story to you. I order Moto G (2nd Gen) my Order In exchange offer I was happy for the amount that I was getting for my old phone so I decided to go for it. I was eligible for two offers 1) Exchange offer 2) HDFC bank card 5% off I booked the order, delivery was schedule for 11th June. Now the problem starts here 1) I didn't got name and no of a person who was going to deliver the product. Flipkart always use to send the name and no of person who will be delivering the product. 2) Delivery boy gave me call right from my door step, and asked me for my old mobile, which was with me and i was at office it was around 4:00 (Approx time) i asked him to deliver at 6:30. he said he cant deliver again and suggested me to collect it from the Andheri Hub at Sona Udyog. and also mentioned it is open 24*7 3) I went to hub at 7:15PM and there I came to know the order has been RTO, customer care has cancelled my order without consulting me. 4) Then there was a blame game, CC said it has been cancelled from Logistic side, and logistic team said it has been cancelled by CS, and also said delivery vendor is new they may not be aware of process. I am aware if I reschedules the delivery for 3 time then the order gets RTO. This is ridiculous and not accepted at all. I have formatted my old phone now have to do all rework on it. How can you guys cancel the order without consulting me. Even after showing my readiness to go to hub for collecting my order by myself. this is mental harassment. And now i have to burn my blood at your customer care no. Hope you guys take corrective measure for it.",

Overall, I had a very bad experience with the phone and with Flipkart. Will always refrain from buying stuff from Flipkart in future.

A call to to the Motorola Call Center yielded a 9000 Rs Quote for complete replacement of motherboard. 9000 Rs to replace the motherboard on a 11000 Rs phone? Are you people offering MOTO G at good prices, so that you can take out all our money in the after sales and services?? Please give me solution for this.",

But 10 days I found the product to be defective where the performance of the mobile was too slow. When i raised the concern to Flipkart, then they gave me a solution to Switch Off and Switch On the mobile and then charge the mobile (crazy solution ever). I tried it but no use still the performance was slow. Later after 20 days I found that the Dual speakers was sometime not working which was a begger concern for me. After I raised a request for Return / Replacement, without any discussion they rejected my request which was such Unprofessional way of dealing with the customer. Simmilarly again I raise 2 more request for the replacement but no one has reached me on my mobile and hence i lost 10K buying this defective product.",

This moto g first generation worked perfectly weel and giving amazing service since last 1.5 years. battery life is amazing. Hence me, my sister and brother in law bought moto g 2nd generation. ALl these moto g 2nd generation is work as far as batter life is concern. the main reason for me to buy new phone was battery life. which was amazing in moto g 1st generation. but moto g 2nd generation is worst for its battery life. not just with my phone but all the moto g 2nd generation phones we bought at my place. i also enquired with few of my friends who bought moto g 2nd generation. every one had battery problem. it takes 4 hours to charge the complete battery and it takes 3 hours to drain if you have 3g data ON. I strongly do not recommend any one to buy this phone. applications response, RAM and display is good Flipkart delivered it well with in time and good coordination",

            "comment": "NOTE: In any case, if u feel exhausted by the length, My sincere advice: Don't read, not even partially. Doing so can result in unintended perceptions. It's written to be read fully as a whole. If u want to leave, do it right now. CAUTION: The review would begin with discouraging buyers, but there's a lot of good news down under. Don't miss that, it's going to help u a lot. Therefore, read the full review, else don't read at all. First of all, everyone who intends to view this review for advice on whether he/she should buy it, NO, Not at all. Check the date and time of this review. Guys, its June 2015. The processor used in this phone dates back to the Moto G (1st gen). 1GB RAM, while it was enough a year ago, its not the case now as the apps are getting more resource intensive. In simple words, they need more RAM. So what should u do. Go for other phones? NO. Other phones, such as Mi4i, have a lot of software issues. For example, MIUI (Xiaomi's OS) alone consumes 800 MB RAM. And it's not so fast either, even with 2 gb ram. I mean seriously, you dont want to shell out Rs 13000 to go for a phone whose RAM management is so poor. MIUI, for all its customisation, is a bug magnet and cause a lot of overheating issues with a phone. So every time there's a breakout (which is often), company issues a statement saying they will release an update. In all the developing course, It's the user that suffers. Seriously, U don't want to risk ur hard earned money and user experience on a smartphone whose quality is limited to regular updates (NOTE: regular update size is close to 800MB). On the contrary, stock android consumes just 450 MB ram and its ram management is excellent and safer. It is pure, simple, elegant and minimalist. You guys might be thinking that mine is a probably hate case against MIUI or Xiaomi. In reality, it's on the contrary. The reason i'm only talking about MIUI is because it's still the best of custom UI's, others are far worse. Anyways, it's time for good news. Moto G 2015, (yes u heard what u saw), the 3rd generation of Motorola's most loved smartphone is surely coming by the end of july, probably earlier. It's going to be the most awesome phone in the budget. It will boast stock android, faster processor, 1080p screen resolution, 2GB RAM, 8 and 16 gigs internal memory models, and will retain one deal maker that's missing on mi4i, Expandable Memory Slot (upto 32 or 64 gigs). You might think that these are rumours. But its logical, isn't it. Otherwise, how do u expect motorola to survive in a world where 2 gigs RAM is quickly becoming the norm. You can also google it to confirm that it's coming. Lastly, it won't be fitting if i don't express my gratitute to this amazing device. I bought the device in feburary 2015. It's best on quality, user experience is the most excellent thing. Hardware is impressive. Designed to hold comfortably in hands. It does not lag. Battery backup lasts for a full working day (not more). Many of you might be thinking that I'm not a power user or I don't play games, Well, u're right. But that's what u expect from a phone this range. I won't claim it's a flagship by any means. It's a mid range device, but a perfect mid ranger. The reason I've reviewed this device so late is because I wanted to gift a 5-inch smartphone to my mother on her birthday, which is in june. So I saw a hell lot of reviews of smartphones under rs.15000 like Asus Zenfone 2, Zenfone 5, Mi4i, Redmi 2, MeiZu mi note, Yu Yuphoria, Yureka, Lenovo a6000 plus on a hell lot of you tube channels like GeekyRanjit, C4ETech, Bailey Stien, Intellect Digest, Android Authority, Techniqued, u name it. In the process, I wasted almost 3 days watching videos, reviews, typing constantly before settling for Mi4i. But it's overheating issues and its dependence on large updates for quality coupled with unexpendable 16gb storage (out of which u hardly get 10gigs) constantly flogged my mind. Then suddenly I saw my moto g (2014), and thought: why not this? I nearly ordered it, just noticing seconds before that most of the phones were shipping with 2 gigs, even when they were priced lower. I thought probably that was because of custom UI's (which is partially true), but I also found out that apps were starting to use more RAM than ever, So I backed out. Though my moto g still provides me with 450mb free ram (which is just enough), but when u think of a year later in 2016, 1gb becomes pointless. A budget buyer usually buys a phone that can serve him best value for at least 1.5 years. And don't forget a 2 year old processor. So DEFINITELY NOT. Again guys, I know it's long but it would rather spare u the 4 day headache (in my case, I had a very fast internet, 30gb plan and did all this on a laptop. For mobile users, it can take forever). So I'm not at all sorry for the length. I coudn't have described it any lesser and better. Hope, It would help most of u guys.",

            "comment": "5/5 for the delivery time by the Flipkart. I got the first and every replacement within 1 day. but 1/5 for the QUALITY of product delivered. Requested for the replacement 2 times and even then the product delivered was low on quality. The quality does seems to be related with the reduced prices of the particular model. Every time I received this product, there was a problem with the display. 1. There was white light spread (as if a white bulb is present) at bottom left and right of the screen display. This light spread was not visible under day light or normal conditions. but was clearly visible in dark with full brightness level and placing a black wallpaper. 2. The second piece I received as a replacement had another display problem. This time there was blue spot just below the centre of the screen, which was clearly visible with a white background. Not only that if a screen was touched anywhere on the lower half, the same blue spot shows some kind of depression and looks as if some liquid is flowing down the screen. More disappointing was that I was told by the technical team to download third party app from the PlayStore to check if it resolves the issue and the app when downloaded was showing an ad \"Your phone has a virus, click to scan\" -- I mean, firstly how a hardware problem could be fixed with a software, secondly that too by a third party app which promotes risky adware, and lastly, what if I do not have access to internet then how could someone download that app. 3. The third piece delivered, again had some quality issues where the display shows the grid lines of the LCD panel on tilting the phone even with the slightest angle. but it seems have to accept the mistake of buying it first place and hence not reporting it again. Also, the process of replacement is not very convenient. I had to contact the customer support team first which schedules a call with the technical team on a specified date and time that means I had to bear with the issue till then. And to explain the real issue is another big challenge because it is very easy to see or observe the issue but very hard and difficult to explain it in words. my suggestion, PLEASE DO NOT BUY this product anymore.",

I never received the product, and thought it worthwhile to make you aware of the terrible service. My first gen phone broke down after 1.5 years of usage, due to hardware issues, and I went in for this device. I ordered it with 24-hour guarantee as I needed it on a priority basis as my work was getting delayed without a smartphone. And the phone reached my nearest hub overnight according to their tracking platform. But until three days, they just kept giving excuses that they couldn't reach me, etc. and kept updating with \"Out for delivery\" at 10 am and \"Failed to deliver due to operational issues\" at 3 pm. We contacted customer care, gave alternate number, still the same tomfoolery going on. Finally they gave up and refunded the amount. They had the audacity to postpone delivery further. Let me tell you, their van comes to my campus almost daily with parcels as there are many who order. And when I'm not around, they leave it with the warden. And this has happened countless times. Probably I'm guessing they never had the phone in stock and were just fooling around. So be wary. My rating is also based on delivery experience and not the product itself.",

With this 2nd Generation Launch I must say Motorola has launched a monster which would eat away the charm of ANY other phone! With 5 inches display it looks really classy.. Looks better than any phone I see around :) Camera is awesome even for dim lights, good battery, very smooth in operation due to 1gb RAM and quad core processor, excellent graphics and above all extremely sleek and handy! There are already huge praises all over the website, I would just mention one thing, ppl please open your eyes and buy a phone which values your money.. I don't understand why they have a doubt and say its Motorola I am looking for something in Samsung!! Please!! Same configuration in Samsung would cost you just double and all Samsung phones look alike!! and moreover FYI - Motorola is the oldest company to launch mobiles! Motorola Powered by Google is the BEST combination anytime with unbelievable price.. I was not expecting 2nd gen to be this low at price! Hats off!! Also, If you have been delivered a defected piece you can get it replaced instead of talking ill over websites.. even Xperia Z1 was replaced by me 2 months back, that doesn't mean its a bad phone! Its just an electronic device, there are chances of manufacturing faults, check properly when you get, use it extensively for a week, analyze it and get it replaced!! Just close your eyes and buy it.. you will love it!!",

Battery is for 1 day in which I play candy crush for 15-20 min a day, 8-10 calls and somewhat whatsapp. (so battery life is not so good) Power saving mode is a good option when you less battery left in this ph. my rating is 3.5.",

While I; sure the phone is good when bought from an authentic vendor- the unit that came through Flipkart was corrupted- did not even have Google Play Store on it. this is a software the vendor/manufacturer needs to preinstall and cannot be done by any other user. Also, I realised this unit had this piece missing quite late as I'm new to Android processors, and was unable to do this online!!",

I call to the FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE 2-3 times daily, for connecting to THIS Technical team...But these people always have only one reply ::::: \"Sir, U will be getting the call tommorow 3:30 PM\"....ANNOYED LIKE ANYTHING, hearing this reply, daily!!!!! STILL I am carrying the defective box with me.... Haven't xperienced such a bad service from any customer care!!!!! In tonight's call, they told that my request has expired and so, i will have to raise a new request!!! NOW WAITING FOR THEIR CALL, WHICH THEY TOLD, I WILL BE RECIEVING TOMORROW NOON!!!!! I think, such negligence should be brought to CONSUMER COURT.!!!!!",

Now about phone, it still heats up but lesser than earlier one,is heavy,camera is average and those who want specially a camera phone dont buy it and the spaekers,they are excellent for hearing a song but when u call or someone calls u the voice go out and u constantly need to lower the volume but....the good thing is and only good thing is for which u can buy it that it doesn't hang and the android is very fast..........so choose wisely.",

First, I received the phone in Moto G branded box without any plastic encasing it. So it seemed to be that I have been delivered an unpacked product. Second the box contained only the phone. By only phone I mean only phone (and couple of manuals). The charger and earphone were included separately outside the Moto G box. Third the charger is not branded by Motorola and it does not have any USB cable. The earphones are Motorola branded but are probably the worst quality earphones (in terms of materials used, not sound wise) I have ever seen. In unboxing videos of Moto G I could see that the charger and earphones were included in the Moto G box itself, but this wasn't the case with me. This arouses a lot of suspicion in my mind \u2013 has Flipkart cheated me out with this product. In Flipkart\u2019s defense the actual Moto G phone is working pretty well and I couldn\u2019t find any signs that I was delivered an unpacked product. But the unbranded charger and low quality phone makes me wonder if Flipkart is taking its customers for a ride.",

I ordered this phone after a long research.No need to mention the specifications and all.Yo can read it elsewhere.I have been using this phone for fifteen days now.I l list out the pros and cons which I felt. PROS : 1.Stock Android so definitely a much better interface than its peers.(not to forget a guaranteed upgrade to Android L is on the cards) 2.Very Impressive Camera 3.Decent Sound Quality 4.Good Design and Looks. CONS : 1.Less Battery Backup 2.One GB of RAM might be a downside for the extensive gamers !! Final Verdict : @13k its definitely a bang for the buck ! Go for it if you use your phone as a phone not a gaming device.And last but not the least you'll get some stunning selfies too thanks to a 2 MP front snapper. :) :)",

            "comment": "First of all starting from boxing,it was pretty standard boxing,nothing special. The box includes a charger but the wire is not USB to micro-USB,it is simply a wall charger,so you cannot plug it into your laptop or anything. Then,there are earphones,which have nice sound quality as expected ,but its not great as you would expect,but the downside is that they are not comfortable.So,be ready to buy another pair if you want to enjoy your music,or if you already have one! Coming to the deal,the phone is absolutely worth every single penny spent. The display is sharp and good color reproduction,the front facing dual speakers also sound good.It has a built-in equalizer which works flawlessly. The voice quality of calls and active noise cancellation is also good. But the downfall,the camera! It is where Motorola cut the prices and its fairly obvious.I won't say the camera quality is bad,but its not great.There is NOISE.Even in good lighting conditions,there is noise.I also find the shutter speed a bit slow on the default camera app, but that issue can be resolved by trying some other decent photography apps.Other than that,the camera is fine.It has good color reproduction,focus sometimes maybe a problem,but generally works fine.The slow-mo video somehow I find is laggy. Coming to the battery! Its fairly good,but neither great.Heavy usage will last you 5-7 hours on 100% charge.But for normal use,it works just perfect,it would last you through a day very easily. The phone handles almost all of the apps and intense games perfectly,with exception of OCCASIONAL lagg.I dont know how it does it,but this phone handles some games that other phones with slightly better specs dont even run. And for the part I'm most excited about,Motorola announced Android L update for Moto devices soon! To sum up,I would say if you have made your mind to buy this phone,go for it without a second thought,its the best one you could get out there for its price point,and its not even chinese!",

Loud & clear voice, no signal problem. 4. Full charge in 1.5 hours at max. 5. More than average battery life. Battery drops to 40% from full charge if used continuously for 4-5hours on data packet mode. But When you do not use it for netting or gaming purpose then battery backup is too good, you will hardly need to charge again on same day. Overall charging needed once a day if used efficiently. 6. OTG support. Cons: 1. Camera quality is lesser than that of Micromax Canvas HD Plus (on my personal experience after using both the phones.) 2. No USB provided with Phone. 3. Headphone quality is not good. 4. Overheating of charger. Overall One can Buy this Phone, its really good to buy. After using it I ordered 2 more MOTO G2 to gift to my relatives. 2.",

In the box accessories includes a charger and a earphone,but i am literally not impressed by the earphones audio quality as i use high bass earphones generally,but may be ok for most of the people.

All the good things I want to say about this lovely phone is already been said by other users, I shall be repeating all over. But the charger and the earphones provided along with are absolutely horrible. The charger gets heated up excessively and I cannot charge my phone during travel in trains. The phone starts behaving strange: home screen icons positions changed automatically, emergency call screen pops up when I want to unlock phone. And the earphones are of such a low quality, I would be thankful to Motorola if they atleast provide such earphones with better sound quality and also which have a sponge cover which would atleast stay in the ear after head movements. 5/5 for the phone 1/5 for charger 0.25/5 for earphones.",

It has been almost a month and I haven't seen even a hint of any lag. It runs almost quite smooth with fluid operation, switching between apps and pages is smooth with some occasional but unnoticeable stutter. Camera is good in well lit and outdoor conditions. Display is good with sufficient clarity and good viewing angle. For moderate to mix usage battery gives a back up of around 15 hrs which is good enough in my opinion. Volumes through the speaker is loud,crisp and clear and doesn't get distorted. My only complain is that no data cable is provided with the handset and headphone is just average. I wold have also preferred Motorola to retain the screen size of 4.5 inch from the previous version. All in all this phone is a good buy absolute value for money. Go for it!!!",

On Monday i received my package. I started using from the evening after i kept charging initially for more than 3 hours i started using it and it is big relief to me that from last 2 and half years i was using 2 mobiles for my offical and personal numbers. Now i had a dual sim moto g phone which is fit for my pocket. Plus points of this mobile are: 1. Value for the money. You cant get better features in any branded model with this price. 2. The camera with 8 megapixel is really amazing for both pictures and videos. 3. The internal memory is 16 gb which has lot of space to store lot of applications. 4. The voice calls have a clarity and no noise difference. 5. The 5'' display and touch performance are really good. 6. The data connection and the internet browsing is good. 7. We have all the google application inbuilt in this and they are working in a good condition. Minus points of this mobile are: 1. Battery backup for this mobile is not so accurate, if we use application's using data connection i observed the battery is discharging so fast. 2. We cant put mp3 audio songs as the ring tones. We will get some default ringtones in the mobile which we cant get one nice ring tone. 3. They are only 2 Motorola service centers in Hyderabad. 4. And in this model the battery is inbuilt with the mobile we can't remove it if we have a problem with battery we must handover the entire mobile to service center. From last 10 days i observed these good and bad features in my mobile. If i find any interesting features i will update. Thanks, ANIL DANDU",

I had been looking for s good smartphone for some time and the G immediately caught my eye. The best in class at the moment is the Xiaomi MI3, which is next to impossible to get in India now, so the next bet is the Motorola moto G. Other options:The Asus Zenfone 5 or the micromax Canvas Nitro. While the asus and nitro are good too, the nitro is a lil better than the G in terms of Specs but most probably won't get the Android L update, which is really important. Design: The G is beautifully built with amazing feel in the hands with its curved back.It doesn't slip from your hand at all and is the best built in comparison to the moto G UI: The moto g runs stock android 4.4.4 and I have never experienced a lag even with 6-7 apps open at once. The phone has been built to run Stock Android and doesn't lag at all offering a smooth user experience Display:A crisp 720p HD display is quite impressive with gorilla glass, which is not offered on the Canvas Nitro. It is virtually scratch proof. Specs: Just look at the specs given online, that should satisfy you. Camera: It has a decent camera for the money you are paying. It doesn't offer a a camera as good as the iPhone 6, which is obvious. Battery: Its a pretty good battery backup and i got 12-13 hours on its, with the Wifi on a times and off at other times. Overall Verdict: It is an excellent phone and in my personal opinion better than the Micromax Canvas Nitro. Just buy it if you have the money.",

I like the expandable memory feature. I also liked the 'ok google' feature of android kitkat with exciting other motorola apps like 'moto assist', 'moto migrate'(great for connecting or miracasting any other device), 'moto voice', 'moto connect'(u can use this app for the connecting device with the mobile), etc. This is a stock android phone with guranteed software update and it has almost all google apps by default..its really very useful!..the hd display is decently brighter than average midrange smartphone and u can use the mobile pretty well keeping the brightness to zero..screen is well protected by corning gorilla glass 3..touch interface is the best as well and its a bit weighty than average smartphone. Other common features of the phone is good and better in some cases than any other smartphone in this range. there is no such negative issue for me with this mobile but i wish it could have the 'NFC' and a more battery power..something like 2300-2600 mAh..;-p so overall i am satisfied by using this handy set and would surely recommend to any mid-range smartphone buyers...coz this the best in class set in its price!!!!",

With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine. 3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity. 4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option.",

They could have allowed us to add custom toggles to the quick settings. The normal switching off and on of mobile data seems to be a chore. You cannot even enable battery percent view by default in the status bar from the battery app. You need to install third party apps to overcome this and it unnecessarily takes up 30-40 MB of valuable RAM. The multitasking control is too vigorous. If you open more than 5 apps and you move to the 6th, it reloads and clears the 5th one from the memory. This happens to the extent that it closes of music player. The music abruptly stops due to this. They could've added 1.5 GB RAM for this device, it would have improved the multitasking capabilities. The camera UI pretty bad. When you take pictures and swipe right to view it, there is lag. Motorola needs to fix this soon. The software is thoroughly under cooked. It just makes root such a necessity, sadly we will root warrant once it is rooted The build quality is very good and that Moto dimple at the back, that. No cover can to justice to that. The battery temperature is constantly getting above 40C if you use 3G with location services enabled. I am sure this is a software related issue. I bought this only because there is a guaranteed upgrade to Android L. If that is your priority, please buy it.",

The phone comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, but i do not see a Gorilla Toughness in there. I have purchased this phone on the Big Billion Day by exchanging my Sony Xperia Arc S, which i was so much resistant to change due to the display contrast and audio quality of Sony as I love it. Finally I made up my mind and placed the order. Got the phone delivered the very next day. Got impressed with the phone bigger display and newer android version. Equipped it with Flip cover, screen guard. But the happiness did not long last. The very next day the phone slipped off my hand around 2 foot from the ground. I thought OK it is a little fall, worried about the scratch and took the phone, but surprisingly the phone top screen cracked, HOW FRAGILE IT IS!!! which cant resist a 2 foot fall in a normal surface, My XPERIA would have fallen from my hand a 100 times it never broken. Here the worst part comes, after frustration of cracking my one day old phone without using much, contacted flipkart. They denied replacement as it is a physical damage. Contacted service center they do not have stock parts available. They have other products which they will replace the complete display and protection glass which cost around 8000 Rs (Flipkart recommended) service center. I have purchase this phone itself for 8000 after exchange. Later on surfing through the internet, came to know that lot of people has this problem with Moto G. A mobile comes with approx 13,000, at least should have better durability and quality, and should have better post purchase service. But with this phone, you don't get any of this, just a FANCY MOBILE for lesser price. Here is my advice, 1. Purchase this phone if you love it, but keep it safe more than your child. DO NOT DROP IT EVEN ONCE. 2. There is no stock parts available for replacements. Neither Flipkart nor Motorola helps you. Unlike in US, they replace the display for free. 3. The service charges and repairs for this phone costs you more than the phone price. BEWARE.",

This was one of the biggest disadvantage of it. Some of the pros of this phone is: 1) It has an expandable memory option 2) The primary camera quality is very good. 3) Even the secondary camera quality is good. I even tried skype calling from this phone and the video quality was upto my expectations. 4) The display of the phone looks nice 5) It comes with a kind of scratch guard, so u dont have to purchase one Cons: 1) The headphones should have been in the ear type. I usually prefer the in the ear type 2) Battery life is OK. But this is a fauly with most of the android devices. They do consume a lot of battery So far so good. It has got a lot of high end phone features and it comes with pretty reasonable price.",

Cons --------- Battery backup is really bad. I use 3g network fulltime. No gaming, no call longer than 10 minutes daily, Only browsing on internet. The battery lasts only 5hrs. And you need another 4 hr to charge it ! - When compared to my Samsung Galaxy, the Network Signal reception capacity is weak. - Volume and power buttons are not userfriendly. - Data Connection automatically misses often. - Micro sim ;) - No USB cable - Microphone sound quality not excellent. - Display quality could have improved. - Motorola Flipcover is too expensive (1700/-). 1200 /- is affordable ! Flipkart and WS Retail - 10/10 for delivery. I will update review later :)",

Its seems big if you were using a small phone (3.5\") before. Camera is awesome, both front and back! Its auto-focus is amazing since it is able to focus on things kept very very close to the phone. The only drawback I can think of is I'm not able to set a mp3 as its ringtone. You can only use the defaults tones given in the phone as ringtones.!! Apart from that, its a very NICE PHONE, GOOD BATTERY back-up, until you remember to CHARGE YOUR PHONE FULL before SWITCHING IT ON for the FIRST TIME!",

The new moto g 2nd gen has surly come out with the lacuna of moto g gen 1, which was lacking a good camera quality and storage space. otherwise moto g rocks!! one cannt resist on falling in love with the mobile. Being a gal, its always cool and fashionable to carry the awesome back cover colors offered by moto g. Infact nothimng can beat the quality of original flip cover. The part is when you close the flip your phone also gets locks.. so need to lock your phone for privacy separately, your flip will do it for you. Battery life of moto g (gen 1 and 2), which was one of the major requirement of smart phone, is great and last for a day and half when charged fully. Ease of access, phone speed, motorola assist, sound quality everything awesome.Worth a smart phone. However m bit disappointed by the WS retailers , not for the product quality but for the shipment time they took to ship the product. On site they are mentioning that they deliver the phone with in 2-3 busiiness days how ever they took nearly on week in my case, inspite of being delivered in metro city only. The courier service EKART Logistics is worst, i have seen . They are not updating their shipment status for 24 hrs and no contact no. to contact the courier company, even if you get your phone call to their customer support they wil keep on you waiting and no representative will be available for you for 10 Min!! and cherry on the cake is you will pay the call cost even for waiting... I really don't know why the reputed site like flipkart use cheap courier service.",

Another quality product by Moto. i have been using it for about 1 month now. Dont buy MotoG2 covers from flipkart, they are very expensive here. You can get them for 150 Rs outside. Only con is battery drains out while using 3G continuosly, but i guess that happens in any phone while 3G browsing.",

Battery life is not average but not also vgood. You can pass half day with fully charged battery. (I play game a lot and use internet very frequently with 3g) 5. Two front speakers do very good job for what they meant for. Problem with the phone. 1. I found very serious issue with network selection between 2g and 3g. I found that there is no setting that you can select only GSM(2g) or WCDMA(3g) mode as per your requirements. This is the only thing that I don't like in this phone. Otherwise this phone can fulfilled all my requirements.",

This phone has a real classy touch on it, the back of the phone adds a premium touch to it. Touch is superb. The device works great till now, games like temple run 2 run smoothly, no lags. No problems with web browsing and streaming hd videos. Doesn't heat up while playing high end games like most other phones. Nice crisp screen but only 720p (works for me). A decent camera, good pictures both indoors and outdoor. HDR included. Although there are not a lot of camera controls or additional features (courtesy of stock android) The front dual stereo speakers are just awesome, they produce loud and clear sound. Battery discharges faster on 3g but everyone knows that.. **Cons - The only thing that I would like to point out is that the charger provided with it tends to heat the device a little while charging. Coming to the point and not talking about the specs of this phone, Moto G gen 2 is a really impressive smartphone probably the best in this price range, first time android users will simply love it. Motorola has provided a great phone at a decent price.",

            "comment": "Before I get into my review for this particular product, I have to once mention the horrible customer service experience I received from Flipkart. It was excruciating in itself but I'll not rate the product down because of that. Now about Moto G 2nd gen, it's an excellent product, especially for its price. It's been almost 20 days now I've been using it and I hardly have anything to complain about. Pros: 1. Very smooth interface. Thus far, I've had no lag or hanging issue. The Snapdragon 400 might be an aging tech, but it still does the job well. 2. Adreno 305 shows its capable hand here. Gaming has been great so far. I've thrown games like Asphalt 8, Fifa 14 etc and it has had no problem handling them. 3. Battery. Yes, it's a good one, at least for someone with my type of usage. After some gaming (approx 1-1.30 hours), may be few calls through the day, always on 3G (and I mean always on internet), few videos (worth an HD movie), it runs for almost 1 and half day. 4. Screen. Corning Gorilla Glass 3. I have no screen guard at present (I've never liked them) though I am thinking I'll get one, but it seems I need not worry as there have been no signs of scratching etc. I'll still get a screen guard though. Not that Pro: Camera: It's average. However, I don't think it's necessarily a problem. It's responsive and takes good enough snaps. I am coming from Xperia's 12 MP shooter anyway, so may be I am biased against this one. 3G signal reception: I had some problem here. It would constantly switch to Edge or 2G even if 3G signal is available. I got around it fine though by changing the setting to 3G only (just dial *#*#4636#*#*-->phone information and select WCDMA only to do that because it won't give you that option through Settings). Call clarity is good through. Overall, it's a solid piece from Moto.",

Thankyou and I am back on board as a loyal customer. Part 2 With an additional 10% discount on Citibank CC, the Moto G2 finally cost me Rs 9,700/-. First impressions - Full value for money. Ecellent build quality. Display: The 5\" screen is good, brightness and richness is good. Viewing angles are acceptable. Sound: Call volumes are good, speakers are acceptable and not very loud. Platform and UI: UI is very minimalistic and therefore the operations are super smooth. No lags whatsoever. The touch is also vey smooth. Very good Wifi and 3G, no lags and disconnections. Several apps can run smootly together - i tested Whatsapp, FB, browsing and mails (all on wifi). Camera: Was a disappointment. Even with 8 mgp, the clarity expected is missing. Downloaded the Google Camera App, it gives better focussing option but reduces the capture angle, but is better than the stock app. The 2 mpg front camera is just passable and ok for ocassional selfies. The flash does some work in low light but nothing wonderful. IF CAMERA is your MOST IMP consideration - i would not recommend this phone. Gaming: Am not into heavy gaming but regular ones like Candy Crush, Subway Surfer, Banji Bananas, Angry Birds run fine. No issues. Battery: With given usage - 1 hr calls, 3 hrs browsing incl mutimedia on wifi, 1/2 hr gaming, 1/2 hr 3G browsing - the phone lated more than a day. Was down to 20% at end of day from 100% (8am to 10 pm). I would rate it very good. Verdict: Good big screen phone, super smooth, ok camera and full value for money. Excellent option for normal users.",

The white color model looks splendid and feels great in hands. NO weight issue at all. Kudos to Motorola for paying heed to user's reviews and demands and incorporating them in the 2nd gen device. Features: 1. Display quality is fantastic and crystal clear. 2.Dual metal front speakers produces great sound. Sound in earphone is nice too and can be enhanced with audio effects. 3. Device performance is really awesome. Multiple apps works well with no lag issue. 4. 8 MP rear camera takes fantastic photos . 2 MP front camera works well with skype and for selfies . Over all It is a great feature-rich device at a reasonable and affordable price.",

Game - Play any game without facing any issues. All games work on the device 5. Kitkat - Needs to update the phone over 120 MB for Kitkat 4.4.4 6. Duel Sim : Micro Sim req. I faced a issue inserting SIM card as it sis not clear which side needs to be insert. 7. Ok Google - Works #1 over 3G 8. Screen - Slide to left & you have all the info of current location, climate, nearest restaurant, etc. 9. Meeting, Sleep mode. 10. Battery life is good. Below are the few points which are resisting my love towards moto G2 1. Heating problem 2. Moto Logo - I was expecting it as Moto X2. I am owning Moto X also.

Cons - the voice quality is very bad, hardly audible in a room with some background noise. Second, the handset speaker is to the right side of the phone - it is very difficult in case you have a habit of holding phone to your left ear as the phone needs to be adjusted up to be able to get clear voice. Third - this handset speaker is the same as the loudspeaker, which makes the voice not so easy on ears and the person around can easily listen / overhear the conversation.",

The display is sharp and clear even with the increase in screen size. Just disappointed with the lack of quality accessories over the web. Well, it should take time. Anyways, special mention to Flipkart : I purchased this device through the exchange offer with a probable 2000 discount. When they failed to pick up the old phone from me, they immediately refunded an amount of 1000 to my Flipkart wallet. Not sure of others, but Flipkart has never failed me. Keep it up. P.S.

The phone performs daily tasks perfectly and the display is nice for watching movies and videos. The phone can handle games like subway surfer, minion rush, gt racing and temple run 2 smoothly and does not heat up much even after long game play. Battery backup is decent and will last for 1 day on moderate usage. The camera has been the most important update and it takes much better picture than the previous gen model. On moderate to good lighting conditions it takes decent enough pics with good colour balance. It is a value for money device at this price though many prefers xiaomi redmi 1s at lower price. But if you can afford it its much better than redmi 1s as it free internal memory around 12.7 gb which helps lot while loading big games. Also the android 5.0 update will consume much internal memory because of the changed API's so ultimately 16 gb internal memory is any day better than 8gb internal memory. Also it has stereo speakers with good enough sound for entertainment purpose and most importantly it runs stock android with no customization unlike redmi 1s which runs MIUI. Stock android has the advantage to get software upgrades faster and it uses much less ram than skinned up ui. My friend has redmi 1s and this takes up much less ram while running apps and games and does not overheat like redmi 1s. Definitely recomended!",

Over a period of time, the society and my job, needed some advance features. I am not a techie. I dont know how to use these smart phones. My two sons use and I never dared to touch them, because I am a smart phone illiterate. I tried many a times, in the phone stores to purchase, but every time, the sales men used to act smart and confuse my mind on every smart phone. At last I made an adventure through the flipkart and I clicked Moto g 2nd gen phone. Received after 4 days. Opened the pack and found....but I dont know how to use it, even switch the phone 'on'. I always feel bore with the manual. The manual makes me that it is an Intermediate maths, physics, chemistry text book kind. So, I took a deep breath and started meddling with the buttons. .........................now I am offering my review. A Very Good Phone indeed, which suits my requirements. I need a phone, my mail, skype. That's it. The price is very convincing when compared to other models. This phone could sound as much as 35000 rupees, but through online, I could get it for 13000 rupees. The battery life is about one complete day, with at least 40 above incoming and outgoing calls, 15 minutes of skype, a half an hour mail checking and watching 4 or 5 Dev Anand/Rajesh Khanna/Shammi Kapoor songs on the youtube. What else I need. I started recommending this phone to my age group...I am 52. Keep it up motorola.

PROS :: packed with snapdragon 400 !! pretty decent enough for this price battery is way better than expected (media-core user am myself) very nice display btw! comes with stock android experience feels solid (best) nearly no bezel dual stereo speakers will blow you away expandable memory guaranteed updates for android l CONS :: camera performance was worse even being equipped with 8mp only one microphone outdoor visibility could have been better phone doesn't come with micro usb- usb cable headphones are cheap by built and audio quality the plastic bezels surrounding the top face were quite disappointing making it feel cheap. but its still the best phone for buck !! believe me its like you are using nexus device! moto is rocking the market now :D !",

            "comment": "Update : Mar 2015 Everything was so good until one day the phone got dropped on the floor and the so called Corning Gorilla Glass 3 just shattered across length and breadth. OK my mistake dropping it but then the service center person gave me the biggest shock. Rs 7000 for the glass alone and then additional service charge ! Thank you Motorolo , I am buying another new phone from your competitor. The glass and service costs 65% of the mobile's price and later to live with fear that this so called gorilla 3 glass will shatter again. Reducing stars to 3! ================================================================ Never thought motorolo would give such a bad product ..battery drains super fast when 3g is on..mobile is getting heated up with even few mins of use..video recording gets stopped abruptly after 30 to 40 secs , this happened several times (not always) but the worst part is nothing gets stored (even that 30 -40 secs of video) when this problem occurs. And again during this 30-40 secs the back of the phone and lens area are getting heated up so much.. terribly disappointed with this phone! I am going to get it replaced after testing for few more days and if the problems persists..Hope i will get a better one at least without heating problem..don't buy this low quality product..I could not return it because i bought it on billion day sale..I believe moto is under pressure due to competition and ended up with this low quality product..moto g 1 st gen was so good and this is an insult calling an upgrade to moto g.. QUESTION TO FLIPKART: I noticed that the price label and bar code on the box was tore away !!! Why ?? Are you sending used products ?? Or you dont want us customers to know something about the product price/barcode, etc?? Overall Moto G gen 2 buying experience is very bad and I hope I will get a better replacement. Please don't disappoint. Update: 17 Oct: Flipkart gave me a replacement. Not much heating like the previous one..Camera functions properly. Overall improvements required: 1) Motorolo should have increased the battery capacity while going for a bigger screen. 2) Brightness on the screen is not that great 3) White color is looking totally plastic..moto g first gen black gave a premium look and feel moto g2 white looks like cheap local brand build .. Motorolo could have priced it a little higher (another 1000 Rs) or so and improved on the above areas.. Update 23 Oct: There is no heating problem in the new piece and battery also quite stable. I think the two issues are interconnected and got resolved in a defect free piece that i got as replacement. Increasing the rating to 4 stars. Definitely you wont get a better phone at this price range.Could have given it 5 starts if plastic feel / look was not there and screen brightness could have been better with a higher battery capacity. First gen moto g is now just Rs.9999/- WOW..WOW ..Worth more than 5 stars on the scale of five!!!",

As said by other buyers its true that battery drains out pretty faster for continuous browsing nearly 6 hours The looks are gud , speakers r of gud quality,primary camera is very gud in day light The con's in this phone is 1gb ram..it Ed be better with 2 GB....accessories are of poor quality... N yes u won't get any file manager or apps out of the box ... However it is I m impressed with the phone n u won't regret it either after all how much more can u except from a budget smartphone...well the things about low budget is different in case of Asus zenfone and xiaomi...

Grip is nice, thanks to rubberised back. Call quality exceptionally good, can hear every single sound. Touch is okay, however faced little issues sometimes. Pros: Display is vivid, colourful, good reproduction of natural colour. Auto brightness works perfectly and no need for manual brightness adjustment. No performance lag so far. I ran some heavy games (Iron Man3, Asphalt 8) for at least 30 mins. No issue except little heating and battery drainage. Good multitasking capability, thanks to Qualcomm. Front dual speaker gives good sound quality comparable to blue tooth speakers. LED notification. Good camera quality. Cons: The home, back buttons are built in touch screen. Takes away workspace except gaming and watching video. Accessories quality are one of the poorest I've seen. these came in white colour however my ordered model was black. Charger is only 550mA, takes hours for charging. I doubt this headphone has output of 50dB. Cant hear a movie while in bus, train, public unless you switch to extreme treble. It gives ache in ears as you need to (hard)press fit into ears. Battery is only 2070 :(",

            "comment": "Had this for a few days now. First thoughts: - I'm upgrading from a Galaxy S (the original one) which had a 800x480 4\" AMOLED screen - so the 720p screen looks fabulous & pictures look great. - I have the battery saver on and I don't use bluetooth, so I'm getting almost 2 days of use out of it (between 2 hrs usage every day between phone, book reader, music and li'l bit of browsing). I'm sure Videos will drain it faster. - Stereo speakers are awesome; very clear and loud enough for my tastes at 60% volume setting. - Moto migrate works much better in this version than in the previous one. All my call history, SMS etc. got transferred without a problem. Note that it'll also transfer all the music & photos/videos you have on the older phone, so be prepared for a long transfer time (9GB of stuff took about 2 hrs). If you have access to a desktop, I'd recommend transfering out the media files with a data cable and deleting from the old phone before you do the migrate. It'll be much faster. - In call volume is excellent and sound is clearer. I think the noise cancellation thingy seems to work well, but that just a subjective opinion for now. For what it costs, I think this is an excellent phone. Caveat: My son has the first gen Moto G and it slipped from the bed & fell about 2 feet. The glass was fine, but the LCD splintered and eventually stopped displaying properly. Replacing the LCD at the official service center cost 4K - quite expensive considering the price of the phone. My Galaxy S on the other hand has fallen nearly a dozen times, sometimes from 4' high. The case has so many dents, it looks like a car fender, but the LCD works just fine. Something to keep in mind if you have butter fingers.",

Was initially unhappy about the changes to the Moto G with the bigger screen and no increase in battery and I would have bought the old one if it was still in stock. But thankfully Motorola knew what they were doing. The 5 inch screen increases the illusion of a 'premium phone' and the battery suits my personal needs which can be moderate to heavy ( I do not play game on my phone). Stock android looks gorgeous on this screen and with guaranteed prompt updates I really can't see the need to upgrade my phone for a good couple of years. I have a roommate who got the iphone 6 and personally, the only thing I envy about his phone is the superb battery life. The phone does take close to 4 hours to go from 0-100% battery so that is a tad annoying. The moto charger also heats up and so I've been using my samsung charger for overnight charges (because I'm paranoid). The phone gets warm with heavy use but it's nothing alarming. Decent covers for the phone are hard to come by and I'm still using it with no protective cover. I haven't dropped it so I can't really speak to how it handles bumps and drops. The camera is not as good as my Desire 500 camera in terms of use and getting shots in focus. I had to download a third party camera app to help with that. Maybe I wasn't using the built in version right but I often found it really tough to get decent snaps. So far I'm really really happy. I'd easily recommend this phone to anyone. I know the price segment is competitive and people have their preferences for what they want in a phone. But this is a terrific phone that has no business costing this little. Will update in a few months.",

They will place another order for me and It would take 5 more days. How pathetic it is. Finally i got the phone after 10 days from my order date. TIPS: if u see tracking is not updating for 2days please do a call back request to check the order status) My first order had some offers associated with this product. but when FK placed my order for 2nd time I didn't get any of them. #UNHAPPYWITHFK Product: awesome in one word. installed many apps (truecaller,saavn,file manager, bms, bank apps, viber,skype) and works fine. games are running cool (s sufer/street skater/ candy crush/sudoku/flowfree). Battery drains out before night if you play games for a long time. Please note charging is bit slower than Lumia phones.",

This is very annoying 3. 2nd gen is not LTE capable but 1st gen is. Somewhat disappointing. 4. 2nd has sd card slot but 1stgen dont. Good. 5. 2nd gen camera is 13mp but 1st gen is 5 mp. But there is no improvement in picture quality. Disappointing. 6. I personally didnt like the looks of 2nd gen. 1st is lot better. The brightness is so low that its only usable indoors.

Device was working nice for few days and a week after mobile was not powering ON. I dialed flipkart for replacement but I couldn't get from them since the box was not with me that time. Though I have all accessories with me but Flipkart refused to replace. Then I surrender my mobile at MOTO service centre (Tirunelveli-Kumar Electronics) on 22nd Sep. Till now I haven't get any information about my mobile. I Hardly use my mobile for a week. Have escalated to moto customer care, but the representative insisted to contact flipkart for replacement. Pls help me to find out where is it now. Order ID: ODA6857978345XOKYN00",

The best thing about Moto G 2 is the camera 8MP primary and 2MP secondary camera and to the surprise the secondary is quite exceptional given its specifications. Primary is worth the price. The sound is good with dual-front speakers audio would not be the problem. But when you hear it from the earphones the differentiation starts. Other thinks as screen and body are good. Price is a bit high its a perfect Rs.10000/- piece but no problem it has Google stamp which can be banked on.",

It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine. 3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity. 4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option.",

Size: Ok Camera: Its really a good buy under 13K for an 8MP camera. the images are really good, and i checked in the low light mode to check the flash and i found that the images are really good Internal Memory: 16Gb more enough for me (and it also can be expandable) Battery: I do surf internet on the mobile mostly, but the battery isnt that good It drains within 5-6 hrs of continuous use of net. and it also takes 2-3 hrs for full charging.

So get good charger.. NOTE--BOTH THE TIME I NEVER USED MY PHONE 2:heating problem : I am a heavy user and gamer I never noticed any heating problem on gaming but while continuously playing dead trigger2 for an hour I found a little heat but it is not over heat and if u face any major heat problem the solution is turn ur 3g network to 2g and restart our phone that will release some ram and make ur phone normal but it continues contact service center 3:battery backup: as I say i am an heavy user and gamer it gives me 6 to 7 hours of battery backup with 3 hours of gaming 2 hrs of video watching and mixed use of browsing website, social networks ,listening music ,phone calls, messages and snapping photos. But in normal usage I'm sure it gives me 13 to 14 hrs of battery backup. NOTE :-The update of android L makes this device to get more powerful battery life so just blindly go for it",

It's like a sort of vibration that is caused(in speaker grills) that feels annoying while listening to music(at full volume). -The dual speakers perform well at low volume(without any distortion) but it's not so loud(even at full volume). -Charger provided is a 550mA charger that wont be able to charge the device faster. It heats up like anything -Display seems to be good and you wont be able to differentiate individual pixels by just looking at it normally. -No usb data cable. (The charger provided does not come with detachable usb cable) -The headsets provided are decent. Shipping and delivery was fast and no trouble with that.",

On checking the status today, they confirmed that the change of Address was not reflected in their Logistics department and they were trying replacement at old address for past 6 days.. Everyday, for past 6 days, they are just re-attempting to deliver at old address and re-scheduling the same saying customer has asked for re-schedule, where as I have never asked for same.. They don't have a simple common sense to call up the customer and find out why the Product is getting re-scheduled everyday for past 6 days.. Also being a Flipkart first customer , they are not able to keep up the service agreements.. A very bad experience with FLipkart delivery..",

Considering the same trust i bought Moto G (2014) White. The build it held was very cheap and in the night I could see the whole top bezel when the LED used to blink. It was unacceptable. Furthermore, the icons were pixelated in 5'' screen. They must have reduced the size of the icons. Though the screen maintained the sharpness but not for so long. The battery was disappointing too. Had to return it with heavy heart as Motorola was my favourite brand and it produced such inferior device. After a long conversation the Flipkart guys moulded their policies and accepted the return. Had it been black version, I might have given it a thought of keeping it. Unexpected call drops and the caller's voice could be heard in a 13*13 room, no matter you get the volume low to the lowest point. Enough said. Bye Bye Moto G 2014",

It gets hanged when i am updating the system software otherwise till now,its running great.. camera quality is jst awsome.If you guys are looking for a spcl camera quality then you should go for it however the standard quality is 6mp but you can shoot multiple pictures by jst keeping your finger on the screen and also you can shoot slow video too..NO lags till now and no hangs.front camera is too slow but you can manage it..It has 5' screen.It has some other qualities too.you dont have to put it in silent mode every time.just adjust the time and it will get silent on your own..Overall,its a grt phone at a 12k price..",

Do not buy , Screen Will break for no good reason , single fall or inside pocket .. no warranty covered even if the outer cover is damaged they charge 6500/- which is pathetic.. Screen gets damaged in 3 ways 1) Outer display damage 2) Touch digitizer damage 3) LCD damage You will have to change all three eben if the uter display gets damaged..",

GPS and other google now apps are very fast and responsive, and i found moto assist is very good app. look wise simple light weight and good. ... hmmmm and wat else.... s music .... its same as my old sony xperia. very good. and \"ok google\" super. ALL OFF YOU WHO ARE LOOKING FOR MOTO G 2ND EDITION, SIMPLY CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY IT. BELIEVE ME. BCZ I DID 3 WEEKS OF RESEARCH ON THIS MOBILE. SO MANY SAID CAM NOT GOOD AND ALL. BUT BELIEVE ME .

Battery life purely depends on your usage, its big screen causes a large drain on the battery so if you are into playing high end games you might have to keep this plugged in very often.

Its good for casual gaming, though i did find a little bit lag when i was playing Minion Rush, dont know why!! Did the benchmarks, and its showing this phone has a pixel density of 320, which is awesome. Yes, the only disadvantage is the battery and a little bit more ram would have been perfect. the battery lasts about 15-18 hrs with medium to heavy usage. Apart from this, just stop looking here and there, go and grab it! Its a steal! :D",

I charged completely on the date I got mobile, and used internet to sync my google account and to download few application. with 2G internet, the battery lasted for only 4-5 hrs. I don't know, its good or bad. Next day without using internet, I just used for playing games, listening songs and others for maximum time, the battery lasted for a day. I would suggest buyers to go for it, based on your requirement, like i don't use internet much in phone, so moto g2 can sustain for 1-2 days, that's good. Sincere request to motorola to somewhat concentrate on battery. We don't expect our phone to manage for more than 2days. but with optimal usage, it should sustain for atleast 2days. I edited this after using it for a week. This phone is awesome, I played games continuously for an hour, the battery drained only 5-8%. No heating problem, simply good in all perceptive. I love the PDF reader features(Black on White to save battery and less impact on eye during night when all light switched off, Reading View option fits perfectly the text to screen but not figures, manageable).",

Also booking and delivery process was also so simple and pleasant. Moto G (2nd Gen) - Wont share product specifications as its provided here already. Color - Bought black color which is nice in looks as well as grip is better on holding if compared with white variant. But again black doesn't provide premium look than that of white. Simple if you want people to notice your phone then go with white else black. Look wise rating - White - 60% / Black - 40% Design - Classic looks nothing fancy, rubber coated back panel provides great grip. Slim, good quality of volume and power buttons. Volume - Call volume is very clear and great, you wont face any trouble while hearing even if you are in the public place. Two front facing loud speakers are also good but doesn't meets up to your expectations. But still better than single speaker phones. Display - Excellent! Smooth functioning. Not a single pixel lost here and there. Camera - Great out door/sunlight picture quality. Night - Very good flash light and picture clarity is definitely better than older moto g or other brand phones like mocromax etc. OS - As soon as I connected my phone with wifi it asked me if you want to upgrade OS and i did immediately. Now OS is - Android v - 4.4.4 | Kernel v - 3.4.42.g668a77b Battery Life - Phone should last very easily least 24 hours with normal use. Also charging time is also pretty fast than my older android devices. Pros - Excellent Display Latest Android OS and upgradable Faster experience Good Camera quality Classic looks And I agree with and copy/pest other reviewers comments on Pros. Cons - (According to personal observations) Charger heats allot if switch is on for more than couple of hours. Speakers - I doubt they might break quality soon if i continuously listen music on maximum volume limit. My phone got little heat up on my first charging at side of camera, but faced this only once so am not sure if its phone's problem/charger's problem or my placement of mobile was not correct while charging (placed near by my laptop fan which blows hot air) My first product here and first review, am so very happy with this phone and service provided by flipkart. Looking forward for more and more shopping from this site.. Overall phone rating(Under this price range)(Hands on) - 9/10.",

When my old phone broke and i was looking for a replacement, it came down to Mi3 or Moto G2. Getting an Mi3 is like winning a poker game! On the other hand ordered Moto G2 and got it the very next day. Almost everything is good about this phone - What could improve is 1) RAM of 2G. Not much lag as of now, but still occasionally you can feel it. 2) Slightly better battery life and a detachable usb charger. 3) The flip cover is too pricey for 1700. That's now the favorite business plan of these companies to make huge money on selling accessories.",

The design was cool and the packaging was great. Solid packing. I have charged the mobile for 8 hours without turning on the phone and I used wifi bluetooth and I see that the battery is still going good. only 50% drained in 9 hours. My samsung star gets drained within 4 hours itself. Moto G 2nd gen battery is great and the price is awesome either. Say bye to samsung era and get back to Motorola era. The 8 MP camera is great than Samsung's 10 MP camera. Definitely worth buying.",

So soon after unboxing I did the first boot and it was pretty quick and the UI was smooth as it should be. the camera is satisfactory, I'm not disappointed with it either, both the primary and the secondary. Coming to the Battery Life, I'm pretty much happy, a whole day backup which i liked on it with an average usage putting it in wifi and texts surfing n etc. Am happy with the performance. The Display is also good. Nothing to comment on it. its Fine. Sound...! oh yea its awesome...! The Headphone is good i would say, you can use the sponge for that to make it comfortable on the ears and u get it for INR. 5. or 10 maximum... The Build Quality is pretty neat in every aspect, the volume rokr and the power key are awesome. The only place where i felt the moto or the google could have given some freedom for the user..., That the apps in the menu cant be customized. It is alphabetically arranged. To me, I feel holding in one hand is a bit tough. may be just to me. As i've been using the Sony Xperia V for past 1 year and which later made some troubles., I switched over to MotoG2 after a lot of research and online reviews and I'm pretty much happy with it. The Call quality, the Display, Battery, Sound, Camera, the Quad Core processor.. Thats what you expect from a phone at this price range. So with 1 or 2 flaws according to me... ill Rate it 4.5 out of 5...! If you are lookin out for a budget Smart Phone with all good features packed with..., This shouldn't disappoint your needs.",

To keep the cost of the phone affordable the Charger, head phones are not of the quality make. Motorola instead of supplying these crappy ones should have given option to the customers to select the charger, head phones and USB cable from their quality products with specifications,keeping the cost of the phone separately. so that those who want to purchase the accessories can purchase from Motorola / other sources.

Done LOTS of research to select this one... Now have used it for about 10 days extensively.. I feel I need not to give technical specifications... So giving only my experiences with this phone;; Performance- Very good, Snappy User Interface ( I preferably use NOVA launcher), No lags.. (But I am not a gaming guy) after installing 40+ apps... RAM still 220-320 Mb free. can be increased if you disable few preexisting apps (If you don't need them). No heating problem...like described in Red Mi 1s reviews Camera- Rear too good for day to day usage.. I need it for clicking notes, newspaper cuttings.. and believe me ... pics are readable very very easily. pics are great.... Only thing I didn't like is camera software as there is no option for decreasing Photo Pixels (we can shoot only att8 MP but not 5 or 6 MP to decrease size of pic) and can shoot only HD videos (not VGA resolution) But again the problem is solved by 3rd party apps like camera 360 . Front camera,I don't need actually but found it to be more than good for video calls... Display- Awesome for the price... but I know there are better 1080 p display fones if you can spend more... Build Quality.. very sturdy, solid, nice design...gives premium look and feel... Battery- Only department that didn't make me elated. Though the battery backup is not very bad and it was not expected to be great either as 2000 MAh can not be a very good support for 5 inch screen... with moderate use easily passes 12+ hours but intensive internet usage with on screen work can drain it in 8-9 hours completely... But still happy... Not much disappointing... CALL QUALITY- SUPERB is the word.... best call volume among all fones I have used till date.... can hear someone on call with hands-free OFF and holding the fone 1-2 inch away from your ear when volume is set to the maximum.. Speakers- very Nice, double front firing speakers is a welcome change here... watching movie is a real fun with sound coming from near the screen instead of back in most of the phones (including previous Moto G).. Overall.... More than a Nice phone at a very reasonable price... if you can spend 13K bucks I would suggest this is better than brands one is doubtful of...(i wont name but feel most of you people can guess here).. can Go for this phone with eyes closed.... And not to forget.... Flipkart delivery as usual has been praiseworthy.. Got my fone on 2nd day after ordering...",

Apple iphone 5C I didn't want to buy Samsung, Xiaomi or Asus products. I was really impressed when Moto G 2 was announced looking at the new add on features to existing Moto G. I would recommend you to buy this product simply because it is awesome and flawless. This phone is listed for Android L 5.0 upgrade which is really appreciable and stands high among its rival's Xiaomi and Asus. Overall a good budget phone under a price bracket of 15K :))))",

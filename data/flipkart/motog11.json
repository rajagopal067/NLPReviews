I observed below two problems after using it for 3 months: a. As moto g2 is an optimized phone on its original model moto g, but phone battery backup is NOT optimized at all and it last only for ONE day. The phone needs to charge every day. b. After capturing a continues VIDEO for more than 10-15 minutes, the phone is getting warm (HEAT) and got hang for few seconds. Motorola should pay attention to these problems and provide some FIX for the same. Thanks",

So folks i suggest u not 2 prefer Moto G2,unworthy from a US brand",

But once I updated, the UI started to lag. Applications started to take time to open. Even the menu would sometimes freeze. I desperately started to search for solutions in online forums. I tried everything, including clearing the phones cache partition, but nothing worked. I had this wrong image in my mind about stock android, that whatever the hardware might be, if its a stock android it will never lag. But I was wrong. New releases of Androids are only focused on Nexus. To expect a decent android experience after OS upgrades you either have to buy the upcoming Nexus device with which the new OS is released or buy any existing Nexus device. Dont trust me?? Update it. But once you are done updating you cant roll back to Kitkat. This is said by the Motorola Customer Care Executive. Well you can actually... but you will have sacrifice your waranty. Good luck with that!",

I was thinking of buying a Xiaomi, Honor 6.....but decided on this Moto G 2,as I loved the Lollipop interface on a friend's phone & also there are certain apps that I needed to use,which were not available in the Windows Store....After spending the 2 days with the Moto G 2, am loving it.....On the downside,the box pack doesn't include a DATA CABLE & the handset actually comes with KitKat not Lollipop,out of the box. Camera is gud,for a 8mp. Slow Mo 720 is an added advantage I must say.",

No doubt the phone is a masterpiece...But earphone is very worst...you can get this kind of earphone in local market for 100 bucks....I don't know why but Motorola's concentration was only on the handset...earphone could have been much better..If you are a music lover then you will have to buy a good headphone... Charger seems poor in quality...Heats after one hour of charging...but it's ok... Overall handset is great!! Go for it... I'll write my next review after using this phone for some days! Thanks!",

It has been less than a month since i bought this product.My first impression of the product was very impressive. The touch screen is decent and resolution could be better(but it is definitely up to the standards). The power and volume buttons are very well located. Holding the phone and the quality is simply outstanding for the price we pay. Already received the lollipop update and the performance is enhanced noticeably. Battery is top notch. One of the best thing is an option for expandable memory. Final say: Bang for the buck. Best phone in this price range. Definitely feels better than all the samsung's, sony's and nokia's in this price range.",

I received this product just yesterday and initially it gave me some Wifi connection related issues , so i thought it might be a defective product. But, today when i tried connecting it to my college wifi, it successfully got connected, so for now i am understanding it to be my personal wifi connection issues. Rest the product looks good. Will update you guys after a little more usage. Thanks Flipkart.. :)",

            "comment": "I am resident of Amritsar Punjab. My wife who uses this phone commutes daily to Medical College, Jalandhar. I purchased Moto g2 in Oct 2014. Recently I received Notification for Lollipop update. When I started download on the night of 29 Jan 2015, it got stuck at 15%. I waited for 45 min. But it didn't increased. Finding no other option I restarted the phone. On restarting the download automatically resumed from 15%. On completion of download it asked to install. I clicked yes. Then it showed shutting down dialogue and then the screen after restart showed Motorola logo with powered by android written below. That was it and thereafter it got stuck there. I waited for 01 hour but nothing happened. I thought the process of installation is going to take long. So I put the phone on charging as the screen was on and then I slept. In the morning I found same thing on screen i.e. Motorola logo with powered by android written below. The phone couldn't be switched off. I had to go to Medical College Jalandhar with my wife. So I decided to go to Motorola service center at 2nd floor, Monica Tower, Milap Chowk Jalandhar. But they told me to go to New Rays Enterprises, SCO 11, Khukhrana Complex, Canal Road, near Khaira Palace, Main Road, Jalandhar as that is the authorized service station for Moto g2 bought from Flipkart. I went there. That center was just awful. There was a single person who seemed clueless about what he was doing. The aluminium partition was shut from inside. You have to give the phone and communicate with that person through a window. I told him the whole story. He removed sim and memory card and disassembled the phone. I was surprised as I was thinking throughout that it was a software problem. Then he took the phone to a well covered corner in the room where I couldn't see what was he doing. He took 10 minutes for inspecting the phone. Then he said that it was a motherboard problem and I would have to leave the phone there. I said I can't leave the phone as I have to go back to Amritsar in about an hour. He then reassembled the phone and when he put back the sim he said the lock was broken. When I asked how he blamed it on me. I was furious. When I checked myself the lock was intact. I wondered that the guy, who can't tell whether sim lock is ok or not, is quoting problem with the motherboard of the phone. When I went to Medical College, Jalandhar I showed the phone to software engineer of the IT department of the Medical College. He told the problem was that the new version didn't install and old version got removed. He is confident that he will be able to install the software properly. I became depressed with the pathetic after sales service of Motorola. No doubt The device is flawless but the service centers are just pathetic. I even came to know that they remove the original LCD panels of the phone and replace them with the fake ones. All this has been a rude shock to me. I was a fan of Motorola device but now I have to really think hard whether to buy Motorola phone in future or not.",

You can't take pic or make call in sunlight(You won't be able to see anything in bright sunlight) * Just 1 GB RAM * No support for 4G Overall it's a good phone but not exceptional. If Lenovo can upgrade the display it will be awesome camera. 5 stars to flipkart for delivering within 48 hrs.",

Pros: 1) G2 has really very stylish look(gorilla touch :)) as compared to other mobile of same range. Also 5 inch screen fits perfectly in my hand. 2) Front camera takes really nice selfies 3) Sound quality is good with dual speakers in it.(but dont expect sound like beats audio :P) 4) With extended memory card slot, it complets your memory requirement. 5) Also, Android L makes MOTO G2 perfect mobile in this range. Rest all the features mentioned are as mentioned, so I don't want to explicitly mention it. Cons: 1) I am quite not satisfied with rear camera (8MP though). 2) Battery drainer. Needs more Power battery since 5 inch screen + android(battery drainer) 3) ONE MAJOR ISSUE, I noted serveral times is that whenever my battery gets fully discharged and then when I plugged my charger to charge and kept it for few minutes(10 mins). After that, I tried to turn on cell by removing charger, but it didn't start for 20-30 mins and was continously showing battery % in charging state(though charger is removed) whenever I clicked the power button. It was quite annoying. Later it automatically got started after 20-30 odd minutes.",

But even if I had bought it for 13K, its worth ! Upgradation to lollypop - Was in doubt whether to update OS but eventually it was worth. There is no lagging wrt performance, UI is refreshed. I don't see anything wrong in updating. - Only issue with the phone is, it's now pretty common in the segment, but if that doesn't bother you.. Go for it.",

When it got delivered it had lots of dead pixels & he did not know that it was a feature rather than a defect. When I found out few days later, I called flipkart and they were brilliant in sending me a replacement. The replacement is brilliant - so a big thank you to the Flipkart service. Now coming to the phone itself - be careful what you wish for. It is a 13K phone and comes with features which is apt for that price and no wonder it has 4 ratings with over 18K reviews. I use Grand 2 so I am comparing against that. 1. Display brilliant, but don't compare it against Galaxy Grand 2, which'd cost another 3 K more. 2. CPU - very comparable. 3. RAM - 1GB vs 1.5 in Grand 2. So, if you are looking to install lots of games that use too much RAM, think twice. If you are more whatsapp/facebook/phone call type person, then this may be the phone for you.",

The performance of the phone is outstanding regarding display, speed, sound quality, handling, network, wifi. I've not faced any issue with the phone so far. Also, the great point is, as promised by Motorola, I've got Lollipop on 22nd January this year. If you're thinking of buying Moto G2, then my opinion will be, don't think so much, JUST GO FOR IT !!!!!!!!",

Sometimes you ll be thrown out of the game (I'm facing this issue in asphalt 8). Camera very good in outdoor as well good in indoor but not like outdoor performance (In terms of focus and quality),Indoor noise you'll find in the pic. Front cam is decent to take selfie. Battery performance is little disappointing.Overall it is a good phone to buy. No need to worry much about the quality , It has good quality in terms of build. Wifi and data speed is very good no issues found so far. I've been using this phone for 3 months and It restarted only once by itself when I was watching online cricket.",

I have accidentally dropped my phone at least 10 times till now. No crack on screen or anything. Very sturdy as compared to other good phones like asus zenfone 5. Water proof- This doesnt mean that you use it while in the pool. it can easily bear some water on the surface. Expandable storage upto 32 gb. Along with my 16 gb internal i have external 32 gb. memory isint a problem. Updates(Moto g is one of the 1st phones to recieve Android L) Cons: RAM- only 1 gb hence multi tasking is a problem, u can play heavy games on medium settings. Camera- i did not like the camera app of moto g2. very average interface. Battery life- same as the moto g1. The screen of moto g2 is bigger than it's previous version hence battery is consumed more. This phone should have had more battery life. Speakers- The voice somewhat cracks at high volume(smooth voice after upgrading to Android L. I dont know how) As compared to other phones, this phone is very good(Asus zenfone 5 has stronger processor and 2 gb ram, better display but it is fragile, not specified as waterproof, voice quality while calling is not as good as moto g2, display not as bright as that of moto g2) In short, Moto G2 is an all rounder for the price. In my opinion you should go for it. This is my personal review. Hope it helped :-)",

Pros: Camera, Sound, software, design and overall other all aspects are very good.",

OTG support, full hd video, and it supports all the functions as mentioned in the 'about' part.. Only cons i can talk about are: ~ First, the battery. It should be of more power. its drainage is very fast. It drains like a flowing water while transferring files using OTG. On heavy usage, using internet, battery can lasts upto 7-8 hours. ~Secondly, The display is not very pretty as compared to the old Moto G. Its colors is not as much bright as moto g. but supports full hd videos without any lag. ~Third, Motorola Headphones are of very bad quality. Even in full volume it sound very slow and not be considered as a good quality earphones. Samsung or other are very good as compared to motorola.. Beside these CON's the new Moto G (2nd Gen) is very cheap and best phone.. One should prefer it under the budget phone.. Thank You..! :)",

I experienced this disturbance each time I attended or called someone. I wanted to get the phone replaced but the customer service agents would just not do it as easily. I was asked to follow a troubleshooting exercise which did not resolve the problem, even so my ticket was closed as- the customer declined the request to replace the device. In my third attempt I was lucky enough to get it replaced. Finally, I was eagerly awaiting the new handset as I thought only my earlier piece had this audio disturbance issue. As soon as I inserted the sim to check the audio , I faced the same issue of audio disturbance It is to my utmost dissatisfaction that I am writing this review as my experience could not have been worse. If it is a company defect then it needs to be highlighted immediately and I believe products when going for replacement should be checked once to be sure that atleast the next time the customer is not left dissatisfied.",

But some minor features are missing such as, voice recorder, self timer camera and it doesn't have other video recording size option, only 720p. But this can be obtained by installing some apps, so not much of a problem. It doesn't support mkv avi mov and some more video formats. But MX Player supports all video formats, hence this also isn't much of a trouble. The panorama is one thing i found very poor about this phone, but still its ease of focusing, lighting and image and video quality makes us forget that. Overall i would recommend it to all who are searching for a good quality phone in this price range.",

And when Moto G2 was launched, I was happy to realize that I can now have a larger moto G with much better specs at optimal cost. But alas, Moto G2 has disappointed me. With larger display comes the proportionally larger fonts and icons, which means, it'll seem like you've watching at a zoomed in phone. I needed a larger display to space more items on screen. However, it just got them bigger in size. Apart from this nonsensical issue, the major two issues I'm facing are: 1. Quick battery draining, as the 5\" display requires larger capacity battery which Moto G2 certainly hasn't, and 2. Overheating. I don't know what's wrong with this series but Moto G2 has a serious over heating problem during charging as well as during working on it. So, now that many alternate options are available in market, I won't suggest anyone to buy Moto G2",

I have installed a lot of applications and use them frequently with lots of games and faced no issues till date. This phone has amazing stereo speakers and a good video performance (though with a semi-hd screen). On the negative side, this phone could have more battery backup (just 2030 mAH for 5\" screen). The headphone is actually bad but you can substitute this with a headphone of a better company (I use xperia z headphone with this one and it is amazing). 1GB RAM will not be sufficient but still this phone does not lag, though it may terminate heavy duty applications at times.",

Every high-end game played ran smoothly mostly giving 40 FPS. Pure Android feels great. Display is just awesome and proves to be the best source of entertainment(Games and youtube mostly :P) in boring lectures. The voice commands and Moto Assist are just amazing. Friends usually end up playing allot on X. And when they start to annoy you, just shout out \"Wake up Falix\" and Moto would listen even in a noisy environment. Ambient|Active display is very helpful. I never use the power button to unlock the phone, it just knows when you are around or wanna play with it and wakes up immediately. Well thats all the good stuff. Coming to the bad ones I would like to exclusively mention the batter. The battery lasts for a complete day on normal usage around an hour of gaming etc.. If you forget to plug in your phone at night, it'll be useless the next day. I would be happy if Moto could have squeezed in a larger battery. A friend bought an iPhone 6 recently. I was playing around with its camera and that was the first time i realised how bad was X's camera in \"low light\". I'm not a professional photographer but i still expect Moto to work on the camera. Rest all about the Moto X is green. If you have an opportunity just go for it blindly (except photographers).",

Takes 3-4 hours to charge from 0-100% \u2022 No OTG cable provided THE UGLY \u2022 The earphone quality sucks big time. Even the Rs. 20 earphones that are sold near railway stations are better. Surely, a 13k phone deserves a better earphone P.S: Increase your budget by 1000Rs to buy OTG cable/power bank/memory card/earphones",

Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today. Using the thing isn't as revelatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was, but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements collectively add up to a device that's worth your attention. It was one of those gadgets that wound up being more than just \"good enough\"; between the price and performance, the Moto G was one of the best cheap smartphones you could own, period. I would have myself bought this phone if not for Xiaomi MI3, but since I could not buy it for myself, ended up gifting my Aunt. And it has worked just amazing as well. The entire functionality makes more sense in the amount of price and features it consolidates for the given structure. And nonetheless, the performance is still beyond mediocre. Its simply stunning. Additionally, the new lollipop features must work equally well ( I haven't made the update as yet, but sure hope to do so.) Th phone is overall brilliantly built for the Indian consumers & I bet you shall like as well. ( Skipped the spec part since everyone is already writing about it as commonly as they should be)",

Overall the package is very good, look & design, screen resolution, camera, processor speed etc. I liked this phone very much and ordered another for myself (to replace my 2 years old Samsung galaxy ace). After just few days of usage, I dropped the phone accidently (which all phone users will do some or the other day). To my surprise, the much publicized Corning Gorilla glass screen broke into pieces. I have dropped my old phone no. of times but never ended up in this manner. After recovering from this shock, I called Motorola service centre to ask the replacement cost ( I understand well that breakage cannot be covered under warranty). This is the time I got next shock, replacement cost is 7000, i.e. more than 50% of the phone value. It was too difficult for me to spend another 7000 within one month of spending 13000 on new phone. Now I am again using my old phone, need few days to make up my mind. Motorola shall advise customers on fragile nature of screen & heavy replacement cost. Special protection screen can also be recommended so that the customers do not blame Motorola at later stage for keeping them in dark. I will request customers to make informed choice, no doubt this is an excellent phone (deserve 5 stars) but if you ever drop this (or any other phone with glass screen), be ready for spending a large sum.

The display is crisp and resolution is quite high. If you set the brightness on auto then it will adjust to a variety of light conditions so that the screen always remains readable - unlike a few other sets I have seen where the auto setting does not give good results. Readability under direct sunlight is pretty good. The sound quality is okay. It is not as good as, say, a Sony Xperia, but still the speaker output is okay. The sound does start to crack if you listen at full volume. Sound output to a headphone is much better. Battery life tends to be poor. I am a moderate user, and never play games on my device or browse for long sessions. I use it with wifi though, and the battery hardly lasts for one full day. But today I got the Lollipop 5.0.2 upgrade, so lets see if the battery life improves. Overall I am quite satisfied with the phone. Minus one star due to battery.",

I dont know if this problem is with my phone or with all Moto G 2 phone. Believe the Moto G will come up with some solution.",

Simple and intuitive stock android controls make your life a breeze. Good battery dischage; lasts me almost an entire day (close to 17-20 hours with wifi/data on, whatsapp, facebook and twitter on, while listening to music). Those who look for a budget stock android experience with ZERO lag, excellent hardware quality and a pleasing to hold phone, go for this.",

The only issue was that offer for replacement of old phone which was was used at the time of buying this product appeared on first screen of order and was not there at the time final order placed. Post delivery calls with flip kart executives and their response against my query was extremely poor. I decided not to buy from flip kart thereon and am still stick to it. May change my decision in future",

Look is not much encouraging while comparing Sony/HTC products but which costs more If switched off while Battery is under ~3% requires a lot of patience/effort to start the mobile again while charging... I think its not getting started till your battery reaches level 10% which sucks sometime. Pros: I like the Camera & Talk to me feature while driving & @home. Overall Performance is good.",

Pros: 1) Look and feel of the phone is awesome. Phone looks very beautiful from the front and back with sleek design and amazing finishing. 2)Screen: The screen is very vivid and very smooth with Gorilla glass 3(but it is not scratch proof).It has an amazing colour punch. 3)Camera-Both the front and back camera is very good.Picture quality is very sharp and colour tint and quality of the pictures are very rich.Low light pictures are also good . 4)Processor:processor is good.No lag still now.I have already installed many apps. 5)Signal strength is very good. 6)It has a solid Build Quality. 7)Gaming and HD Video recording is not excellent but it is good and met my expectation is certainly better than samsung phones under 20 K 8)16 Gb internal memory and applications take less phone memory when transferred to external memory card since the android is vanilla and original from google in the device like nexus. 9)Speakers is simply superb and video call quality is also very much satisfatory Cons: 1) Battery back up is not as good as moto g 1. But it is still good. 2)File manager is not delivered here.And pictures canot me moved directly from the gallery.Either You have to connect to PC or have to download a file manager. 3)Very bad Ear phone 4) I really doubt its hardness...I am sure it is not like galaxy grand or other samsung /Nokia device,You have to use it delicately 5) There is no data cable provided in the box It is an amazing phone from worlds first mobile phone manufacturer.Only through online sell It has spreasd like hell.You can go for it blindly.",

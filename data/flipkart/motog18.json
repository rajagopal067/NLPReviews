As Moto G, G2, E and X are focussed on India and other 3rd world countries, it gives better Value for Money for Indian buyers compared to other non-Indian phone manufacturers.",

Battery (Yes, all that u have heard about battery is absolutely correct) Have to charge it minimum 2 times a day. Hoping that ANDROID L solves the issue to a bearable extent. 2. Accessories are priced as if they have included an element of gold in them. 3. If u use a high ended app for 20 minutes and return to screen, it freezes for 5 sec. 4. Screen was much better in former model. 5. 80% of your RAM is consumed in default operations Plus- 1. Ultimate Android experience for 13000 bucks (believe me google services like map, etc cannot be enjoyed better in any other phone of this category) 2. Two mics solves the call quality issues 3. Cam has been drastically improved. 4. Screen size and icons looks way better than former model. 5. SD Card, speakers, etc are all good as specified in earlier reviews. So all in all, have a power bank and welcome to a whole new world of android",

Probably the QA team at motorola India is not doing thorough checks on the phone and the service centre folks sound like lame ducks have no experience in hardware/software or a clue of what the problem is. Hopefully flipkart solves the problem soon!",

Camera quality : Moto G (2nd gen) beats the first gen by a good margin. Pixel density in Moto G (1st gen)-324ppi and in @nd gen... 294 ppi, but it doesnt make any difference. Design: Both are well designed but 1st gen is easy to grip and has better back finish. Volume and lock keys in second gen is not so comfortable to use as in 1st gen. Battery: Moto G (1st gen) has enough battery capacity according to its screen size but second generation is not upto mark @2070mah... it should have 2500 mah atleast. Touch: 2nd gen has smooth touch experience as compared to 1st gen. Overall both are good at their price point and its upto u that you want to use a 4.5 inch screen or 5 inch.",

Packing was good and product was seal packed very well. Motorola G 2nd is a great phone ,i realized after seeing the phone, nice build, and beautifully finished. It has 2 speakers one at the level of hearing( as usual) and other is at microphone level(which creates dual stereo). after using it for a day, i can strongly recommend this over zenfone5, mi3 . battery last for a day on continuous usage which i suppose is good. overall an awesome phone !!!",

            "comment": "I am writing this review after using this handset for 1.5 months. 1st of all, kudos to Flipkart for their fast service and seriously some ultra tight packing. Now coming to the handset from Motorola. The handset looks amazing with it's 5 inch screen and dual front speakers grille. The rear finish looks good with the 8MP Cam, Flash and Moto Logo(with a slight dip) that feels good on touch and feel. Feels good, a tad heavy, when held. Build quality is good and sturdy. Under the hood. Well, I would say I am actually a bit disappointed with the specs provided. RAM configuration, Processor and Graphics all are the same as the 1st Gen handset. They should have been upgraded a bit. The screen size has been increased, and it does consumes the battery a bit more. This is till now the biggest disappointment in this handset. I don't have any games nor heavy apps. I use watsapp and zomato apps. Without doing anything extra and lowest level of brightness, playing no games(strictly), gps settings switched off always battery back up is mere 1.5days. Think if you have much more apps and games, it will drain down the battery within less than half a day. You can watch few videos in youtube and check the battery level. Performance: There are lags, yes. i have been facing lagging issues. It takes time to switch from apps to main screen, or even a worst experience I would say is, it hanged few times and the phone system froze. I had to restart the device. A big improvement needs in this section if Moto wants to go ahead with this series. Sound quality is good in the speakers, if you have a good headset/headphone, it does pretty good. Default Moto headsets provided are waste. Display is crisp and clear. Touch is responsive but again sometimes lagging interferes. Rear and Front CAM quality is pretty nice. Pic editing options are nice. You can also download Google Cam app for better enhancements. Call quality is good. Till now I didn't found any call drops. No extra bloatware. Some good apps are pre-installed from Motorola that are helpful. Build: 4/5 Cam: 3.5/5 Performance: 3/5 (Even though lagging issues are there) Battery backup: 2.5/5 (Should have been increased to atleast 2500 mAH from 2070) Sound: 4/5 Display: 3.5/5 Call quality: 3.5/5 UI response: 3/5 NB: I am not comparing this handset(except Moto G 1st Gen) with any other company made handset. You will get phones acc to your budget",

One good thing I learned out of the countless messages I sent to Flipkart asking them what order status was that these folks respond FAST. I'm not saying the responses are particularly helpful, it's just good knowing that these people do give some damn. On to the product review.. Honestly, the only problem I found with the device was the fact that the notification light ONLY GLOWS in one color, white. This is not something that can be fixed by software modifications(sorry, rooters). Camera quality is sweet, Well, at least in well lighted conditions. Front camera is also decent enough to show all the ugly pimples in your face. Again, in well lighted conditions. The stock launcher is clean and fast. There's a catch though. You can't add any new pages in the homescreen. No biggie. Battery life is average-ish. I know a lot of people are complaining about the display and the ppi and all... but it's really not that bad. I'm not really a techno-enthusiast, i don't spend a whole lot of time comparing different phones and all, so maybe it's just me. But I really love the display. Keyboard. Keyboard has a noticable lag sometimes while using certain applications. It does disappear after some time, so that's kewl. The body is elegant. I mean, I'm holding this big-a** phone in my hand, and I'm telling myself I can't believe I bought it just for 13000 INR. So final verdict. If your budget allows it, buy it.",

I got this so that I can receive latest Android updates for a pure Android experience. Or else could have gone for other cheaper and perhaps better phones like Xiaomi Redmi 1S or even Huawei Holly. But then they have customised Android and resptricted updates. 1GB RAM instead of 1GB would have added a little more value to this handset. It doesn't lags or hangs, but almost 80-85% of RAM is always consumed in running apps and system files in the background. Battery life hasn't impressed me much. Its just an average one. But a OK OK phone actually. I am quite happy though. So, if you are looking for the purest android experience and gauranteed future updates, then go for it.",

            "comment": "Hello All, First of all Thanks to Flipkart for delivering so quick.Second, regarding the product fault dont just blame Flipkart as even they don't know what's inside the box.This is my fourth handset buying with Flipkart and the very first time was dissapointed with the delivery after using it , firstly with the brand and secondly with Flipkart as anyone would be for delivering such piece and thinking why me.I fond the product in faulty stage as one sim slot was not working but still Flipkart replaced the product with a brand new box pack,still after using 25 days, so thanks once again.When Flipkart says 30 days replacement guaranty they do. I bought this product after doing extensive research and comparison between several brands online. Now about the product review.I am using the product now from almost past 1 month and the review is based upon that. PRO'S: OS : Kitkat latest version Display : HD.Delivered what they said. Screen : Goriilla Glass.I used almost 15 days without any screen-guard but still couldn't find any scratch on the screen but It doesn't mean MOTO G doesn't need screen guard. WiFi : Signal Strength is too good.I was still able to connect to my wifi router when other devices failed to coonect at that range. Design : Feels good in hand. Camera : Does what it says.Takes quality pictures Speed; I didn't had issue till now opening 5-6 apps at the same time regardless of apps or games or anything. Network : Though its a dual sim phone, till now no issues with the network or call dropping. SIM Selection : You have an option for calling from one sim and sending messages and using data network from other sim.Even you have option for ask evrytime.But keep in mind that when you use one sim while talking or calling your other sim becomes unreachable. Battery: It gives better performance even i use it with full performance.But still u need to charge it after heavy use of 6-7 hrs. of callings,gamings and all other stuffs.If you use it only for calling 10-12 hrs. you will get at least with some percentage left. Sound Quality : Good whether its in call or listening songs(though dual speakers but you will not find much difference) Moto Assist : behaves as you behave.if you are in meetings set it and will not get disturbance...if you are sleeping set it will not disturb your sleep and other options. CON'S Headphone : Included headphone doesn't provide what expected.Sounds are low and you barely hear or listen anything except if luckily you are alone.When i use my other headphones like samsung tab's it sounds great.But you can't expect much at this price range. Features : If you are used to of Samsung user or any other brands you will find it with less features.It will take some time to used to all features of MOTO G and sometimes you might feel it was so easy to find in other devices.It doesnt mean it make it lesser than any other brand. Battery : Sometimes it might disappoint you when you are really in need.So better keep charger with you all the time as backup and also try not to use so much of apps and features which are not needed. Sim Slots : Micro Sims.If you don't have micro sim before buying or placing order please arrange it before.Or else you might have to cut you sims or have to use sim adapters which are not much of helpful. This review is based upon 28 days of using using now.If i will come to know anything which are needed to tell, will surely update.But till now, not all but almost Motorola has delivered what they are saying.Till then, if anyone who is looking for any smartphone at this price range i would really recommend it to anyone.",

About the MOTO G2 , I was previously using HTC ONE which was for 34K and had mind blowing features. This time my budget was low and i was looking for the same feature as HTC one . I ordered this phone i was quite nervous but after using MOTO G2 i cant find any difference between these 2. MOTO G2 is such a power packed phone for such a low price . Spending every single penny on MOTO G2 is worth. Some people are afraid of the back cover thing , but let me tell you ,it is very durable just because it looks flexible does'nt mean its cheap plastic.If opting for any other phone at this price range is waste. My verdict is to go for MoTO G2. Thank you MOTOROLA & FLIPKART :)",

I have observed the same behavior in \"safe mode\" also. Temperature is touching 42\u00b0C. The upper back portion and the upper front portion of the screen got very hot after normal uses. It is not possible to take calls immediately after using the camera, as it is not possible to keep it near ears. Signal strength including the WiFi signals are excellent. There is no SD card. Observed the same behavior in \u201csafe mode\u201d also. I have updated the phone and reported this to Flipkart and now waiting for their response. On November 03, 2014 i have received the replacement against my problematic Moto G2. But the same issues are there in new piece of Moto G2. Its heating too much (44 \u00b0C) in normal operations. Now i think its an manufacturing defect because my friends are also facing the same issues in their newly received mobiles. Now this time i have requested Flipkart to return my whole money back and waiting for their response. On November 07, Filpkart team has accepted my request and got agreed to return my whole paid amount back to my account. As i have already done all the required R&D on this product, hence they have not asked me to perform the same again. They have collected the faulty device and will return the amount with in next 7 business days. Here I like to appreciate the kind of support i have received form team Flipkart.

Some are good, some are not, some go up, some go down, everything is a risk and full of surprises, some good, some bad. Buying this Moto G is like investing in a Fixed Deposit. No special profits / bonus / features. But no negative surprises either. You will get what is promised; a sturdy, reliable handset. Some things I noticed after using it for over 1 month: . Battery does take a longer time to charge . Menu buttons are on screen so you will effectively get 4.7 to 4.8 inches of usable screen space (unless the application goes fullscreen eg. images, video, games) . Although the online reviews say the phone does not lag, they say it after using it for 2-3 days. It does lag a little bit after I have installed some applications. But then I think most phones will lag after you have installed some applications. . NO BLOATWARE (Hello, 'Micromad', sorry, 'Micromax' are you listening???) . I think I believe in the policies / strategy / ideology of Motorola and hence I feel happy by using a Motorola phone which I don't think can be said about Micromax. . Motorola phones are well thought out and take user experience into account, which Micromad, sorry again, Micromax is trying so hard to ruin. . After considering all the specification of the competing phones, I think I ended up paying around Rs.1000 premium on this phone. But I think its worth the satisfaction & peace of mind.",

The interface is good, specially after having seen Nexus 5 with my sister. Can't really compare both of these phones in terms of hardware, but seriously...in this price, this THE best fone...go for it guys. It looks good on the hands. Samsung fones have disappointed for a very long time now in terms of feel good factor. This is nice !",

So summarizing A GOOD PHONE AT THIS PRICE BUT NOT THE BEST ONE. We may find better specs phones cheaper than the MOTO G2.",

I ordered Moto G2 gen with lots of expectation as it was my 1st smart phone. But dejected not once, twice but thrice. Yes I have to replace the mobile for 3 times where all the 3 with unique issue. The 1st one had a deformity in screen where i couldn't spot as the mobile comes with protective guard after a couple of days when i view it against the light i could spot it FK . The 2nd piece is where 3.5mm Jack was very sensitive if i turn the earphone or any 3.5mm plug the music stops or pauses. * While playing asphalt 8 with medium graphic mode it just came out with a note the the app has unfortunately stopped. The 3rd and the final piece was something unique: The I couldn't add more than 2 alarm where the touch goes erratic or non responsive Has same issues as above with games. any video more than 5 to 10 minutes the screen turns white and whole phone hangs where the video getting saved but cannot be played. I.e the file not supported. Flipkart was understood the issue thrice and have done their best. where they gave me options of either replacement and refund of money. As a whole the phone's func is not up the specs. *defective pieces being regulated by WS retailer But the flipkart is doing its best for keeping its customers. I would recommend to buy any thing in flipkart but make sure its not from WS retailer.",

After two days the display started creating problem. Some areas of the screen would not respond to touches, wi-fi hotspot would work at its whim. Once, the display was gone completely for a day. I have asked for a replacement and awaiting it. I can only hope that this time it will be a good one. If it is not faulty then the phone is excellent one, just like its predecessor. Leaving the screen resolution which has been reduced a little, everything else is a little better than the first gen moto G. EDIT 30th october: I received the replacement yesterday.By today it is also showing up with similar problems. Some areas, specially on the top portion of the screen would not respond to touches.Now I am not sure what to do, should I go for a refund or ask for 3rd replacement! Edit 8th Nov: I have decided to get refund. I will try another phone, probably nexus 5. My conclusion is that ,no phone is bad if you get the fine one. In review of every phone I see some dissatisfied customers.One can only hope that the piece he gets will be a good one. Thats why I have given the rating of 5 star, in spite of having problems. Because if those particular problems were not there it would be a wonderful phone.",

The Phone: The display is brilliant, although it has a lower dpi when compared to its previous generation. The sound is good, but not brilliant. Doesn't really look like a huge 5inch phone, and fits in the pocket really well. Battery runs pretty well for a day, inspite of slightly heavy usage, and doesn't get warm/hot. After 2 days of use, I haven't really found any bad features on the phone. Will update if I find any.",

I felt, it drains out pretty fast and may need 2 charges in a day for a moderate - high usage. I used it to play games and browse internet on WiFi and felt it drained out pretty fast! 1hr of watching video on Wifi ate up 30% of the battery! I'm not sure if it is normal. There was also little heating up of the handset but that is kind of excepted from all smartphones.",

On the whole I would like to conclude that it is the best smartphone when compared to other smartphones in this range and it will be updated to Android 5.0(guaranteed) and it is from google what else on can ask for in this budget.So go for it and own a moto!!!",

Fake Offers & Demands --------------------------------- I bought 2 nos Moto G 2nd gen on very launch date 6th Sep 2014, 12.05 AM. The prices of covers and cases looks funny (you declared the customers as fools). I am provided with 50% off on cases & covers. Till now I didnt receive any sign of availing the offer. Called plenty of times with customer care and sent plenty of emails and got some irrelevance or improper response. Do you want the customers to wait more than 10 days and run behind you to avail the offer? Plenty of fraudulent things under Terms and condition. Saddest thing is it is not visible anywhere when you place the order. I promise this would be my last order in flipkart. If you guys keep on treat customers like idiots, soon you will lose them",

Also get SMS alert for each stage of delivery. While I lived in USA I used to order items from Amamzon.com and Walmart.com. I thought online purchase will not be possible in India but Flipkart is beyond my imagination related to service. Only problem I could not find everything what I need online from India through Flipkart. Hopefully they may expand within the coming few years. Regarding MOTO- G 2nd Gen, it seems I got a very good phone for the price. For me 5 inch seems little big comparing to my iphone 4 what I used. I preferred a 4.5 in screen size because my palm is small. I liked the fatures with specification of MOTO G 2nd Gen and therefore I ordered it. I cannot give a perfect review at this time because it is too early to any thing. I will start using it all the time from next week. I have to get a new Micro SIM from the BSNL.. Temporarily I am using a cut to size SIM which I don't prefer. However based on the features, I would like to recommend this phone for those who are looking a good, mid-range ( below 15000/= ) smart phone. I also purchased a Motorola flip cover for the phone. It is very good, fit's perfect, but the price is little high for a flip cover!!.",

Pictures in dark background also look good. 6) Video quality is above par. Cons: 1) Battery life is not what I expected. It lasts for around 9-10 hrs with internet on, music and gaming. Need to install battery saver it seems. 2) They should have provided some more pre-installed apps like facebook, gtalk and folder browsing. Apart from these 2 drawbacks, this phone provides awesome user experience. Would recommend it to those who are looking for a good phone in medium budget :)",

To my surprise, all my fears turned out be false. In fact , it has been a very pleasant experience . I really congratulate guys at Flipkart for the excellent show. You have really changed the perception of people like me who would still prefer walking to a store to purchase the Electronic Items. The delivery was done just 3 days after the booking than the tentative date (Which, I believe was 10 days after the boolking). I believe you guys are more conservative on the delivery date.My advise is to make it more dynamic than a static one based on the purchase of the item. Overall it is a wonderful experience and you would soon see me ordering more things on your site.",

Stock Android, plus this has great chances of getting updates from Google. 2. Since no UI extensions are there, if you like Android, you would love this too. 3. Nice feel of the phone. Light in weight 4. Pretty good ease of use 5. Good sound quality Cons 1. Battery lasts a day - but I guess all smartphones do the same. 2. Its not full HD",

The Moto G which was delivered to me had some light showing through a minute gap on the panel. Flipkart replaced this in two days and all is well with the replaced phone. My niece also ordered the same phone. The delivered phone had white patch on the display. Now she has asked for a replacement. I feel that Motorola is shipping phones with defects or they are recycling phones rejected by customers and sending them to new customers. Which ever it is , Flipkart and Motorola needs to have a closer look at the quality of the phones being shipped.",

            "comment": "Got the phone on Big billion day.. Definitely one of the best phones esp in this budget.. PROS: 1.Camera Quality: ---------------------------- #A read a lot of reviews stating the camera is just good.. but for my surprise it is one of the best 8MPs.. #Even in Low-Light with Flash the noise is very low.. #Photos are stunningly vivid and crispy.. #Front cam also takes clean and bright images...good fr selfies.. #BUT the camera app is very buggy. Cant focus properly. Auto-Hdr doesnt work well.. But its not the camera's fault.. may be a software update or a diffrent app may fix them 2.Stereo Lound Speaker: ----------------- I have to elaborate on this part...What to expect and what not to.. #Expect RICH sound with good bass when placed nearby, like 1ft or 2ft.. i.e. when seeing a video or hearing songs when browsing... #Much Much better than usual MONO speakers.. you wont feel like hearing in a phone's LS.. bt as if frm a mini portable speaker #BUT dont expect super loudness. #When placed far away you wont find the stereo effect not the bass. #Lodness is surely above average but the quality degrades when we reach 75% of max volume. To summarize.. Its awesome when placed nearby.. Nice, when placed far.. Definitely a Loud phone.. 3.Call Quality -------------------- One of the LOUDEST phones i have ever used. Seriously.. Even in Noisiest streets I can hear crystal clear with my call volume set at just 60% or so... Also the voice clarity is rich..no static or call drops.. 4. Display: --------------- Bright,Crispy, Beautiful. I have not used many smartphones so I dont know in comparison with S4,Note,Z or whatever.. #The display is very bright.. I drive in my bike using GPS and I never struggled even when the sun is super bright.. SO good sunlight legibility.. #Yes it is using Moto G's same display but 294 PPI is more more than enough.. no one is gona use a microscope i guess.. #The pics are super vivid and crispy guys. #The lesser the PPI the lesser load on CPU so the same battery on Moto G could handle the extra screen real-estate. 5.Battery: --------------- I am not a Gamer but I do browsing a lot. With 3G On for around 4-5hrs and 1-2 hrs of call and messaging and hearing songs in LS the phone lasted me a day. This is more than enough for me. The charger is a bit slow. 6.Design --------------- Solid build quality. No squeaks in the back panel. Phone feels sturdy at the same time light on hands. I was using a 3.7incher and was worried abt getting a 5inch fone as I have to use both hands.. All the worrys flew away when I handled this device. Light weight, rubbery back, solid on hand.. cant get better.. Yes.. sometimes I need both the hands.. esp when pulling the notification panel or typing a web address in chrome... Google has to consider and redesign them so that key tasks are accessible from bottom right area itself.. I used Nova launcher and set gestures for notification panel and sorted out things... 7.Misc ------------------------- No heating issues on 3G or in calls..No idea on gaming.A cool device. There are few software glitches and bugs which google must fix..like.. Auto brightness is not well caliberated.. Auto-rotate creates a small pause when hearing songs as if it taxes the CPU... there are tiny lags occationaly even when less apps r installed.. Maybe Lollipo will fix all of them... We are one of the devices to taste Lollipop early.. whoo whooo...\\m/ So overall a very good product.. Carefully designed.. Scores well in both looks and performance.. A definite multimedia device in this budget.. Highly recommended for those who expect Value for Money...",

This was not at all what I had expected from Flipkart. They should really do something about it.

The HD display is also give smarter edge to this phone. The speed, internal memory, pre installed apps, moto alert app are awesome. For this price the phone is excellent. As you know every coin has two faces and same is also applicable here. 1. There is no data cable in the box. 2. The charger plug pin are not as Indian standard and you will face loose fitting during charging. 3. The menu display of apps is disappointing i.e. if you reach to last menu display you have to scroll again to reach to first display.",

The same goes with zenfone5, A very close inspection tells that zenfone may have higher ppi but that is not the case too. So i am spectical about it. Coming to battery and charging, Using samsung and other chargers, The part near camera heats like hellll.. Sometimes, the input precision gets bad. You have to clear ram to get back to normal. Gorilla Glass 3 claims are odd... The moto E and moto g 2 both have a bad quality glass too than note1 having GG1. HOW IS THAT AGAIN POSSIBLE?? moto e display when pressed shows signs of display rainbows. Moto g2 doesnt... But scratch test using a small stone showed bad results for both moto phones than note1. The battery percentage does not fall uniformly.. In a gameplay of 15 minutes. It went from 67 to 63. But in next 15 minutes of standby it went to 54.. It always happens only after gaming consumption.",

One cant use short and sweet ringtones due this problem. Its good for Nothing if you miss urgent calls throw such phone out from window, Phone is meant for ringing normally but this phone sucks same is the issue with Moto E, I have been trying to get some help from customer care but they are donkeys. I don't like the way the ringtone pattern is, its not absolutely ridiculous, waste of money buying a half dumb phone. I wont recommend anyone buy a ringtone dumb phone.",

I know the benchmarking and all. I know on bench marks it will be placed higher than moto e. But anyone just use both phone and compare moto e is noticeably faster. Its very laggy in short 2. Call quality is pathetic ( taking into account its 2014). Its so muffled cant recognize the words and sentences. Conclusion: 13k i think usability wise this phone is not so good",

I ordered a Moto G (order no. - OD000945876499706200)in exchange for Nokia X3 - 02 on big billion day and a day after that ordered Xiomi MI3 (Order no. - OD000948904972772200). The courier guy came to my residence on 11th October with the order and to my surprise both orders were in same package(which should not have been the case as 1 of the item was under exchange). The battery of my return item Nokia X3 - 02 was not charged as the courier guy came without calling me, so i had no time to charge the battery. He said he cannot hand me over the order without confirming the IMEI no. of the exchange item. I said ok you wait, I will charge the device. He said I cannot wait and went back without handing me the order. I told him atleast hand me over the Xiomi MI3 for which i have paid in full and that is not under any exchange. he said I cannot as both have the same tracking ID. yesterday i got a message that my order has been cancelled. I want to know who authorised the cancellation of the order. This is sheer non sense on your part. I am highly irate. I have called the customer care atleast 10 times since yesterday. I even visiting your warehouse facility in Patparganj Industrial Area last evening. They also refused to hand me over my package for which i have paid full money. They said return is marked on the order and they cannot help me. Customer care says they also cannot help. and i have to order the product again. and when i tell them at xiomi mi3 is not available. they say its your problem and you have to wait for it to be available again. Now i dont know, you guys track my order and I want the Xiomi MI3 and I am not going to wait for. If this issue is not sorted out I assure you to take it to consumer court as the product i ordered for and paid in FULL by credit card was not handed over to me. Few things I want to know - 1. Why were 2 order clubbed under one ( when you knew 1 of them is under exchange) 2. How can you keep me from having something for which I have paid in full!! 3. Its been 12 days and I still dont have my handset. Just because of your silly mistake. I have suffered for so long. When will i receive my Moto G (2nd Gen) OR MI3???????????",

Phone is very good for web-browsing, email, switching between multiple open applications. However, it looks like I got a defective piece. If you turn up the in-call volume to about 80% (which is required to listen in even a slightly noisy environment), the voice seems to crack badly - as if the earpiece diaphragm is torn (remember listening to audio on really cheap speakers, how it feels?). Same is much more true for Loud speaker. The call volume is low, but more than that, even for call to be audible in a relatively quiet house, the volume level needs to be set to about 80-90%, and there, the voice cracks much worse. It is unbearable. I tried various things: tried SIM cards of Airtel, Vodafone as well as Tata Docomo: all have full signal in my house, and all of them have the same issue. Important thing to note is: it is only call quality that is so poor. If you play Music or Videos, they play fine. Secondly, battery backup is terrible. With moderate usage, it does not last even 12-15 hours. That is in the first 1-2 days of usage (after full charge). If you browse continuously for about an hour or so, the battery will drain easily by 40% I have raised a return request with Flipkart due to defective earpiece & loudspeaker. I am hoping to get a refund.",

Also it comes with out of the box kitkat 4.4.4 version with a guaranteed update for android L (now known as lollipop). A great flaw in flipkart: Don't ever use the services of Delhivery courier facility. It is probably the worst courier facility in terms of delivery time. It took them almost 2 weeks to deliver my simple order. Thumbs up for Google which is coming out with such great phone. Expecting Google to launch more such phone now with the advent of MOTO 360.

As mentioned by the customer care it was stated that the problem will be resolved by 28th by 11.30 am. The first call itself came after the time and they suggested to install and try the software \"dead pixel detect\" from google play station. well it did not work and when I again called customer care they again took it as a fresh complaint stating the previous was resolved and have again changed the date to 31st. Excellent work flipkart. now i know how you guys state that you get the customer problem solved fast. you just give a suggestion and state that the problem is solved and if the suggestion does not work you take it as a fresh complaint.",

Unfortunately, no one contacted me & i have raised multiple complaints for these issues every 3days once, but so far no responses. Finally raised replacement request, they simple rejected without providing any valid reason for rejection. I can see lot of changes in customer care especially response comparative to previous experience, i use to get responses very effectively & timely for all these queries, but know totally am looking confidence & trust on Flipkart.

Camera is good as compared to the previous version, but not the best in segment, but usable for me and for those who are not that camera junkie 3. Front speakers, loud speakers and timely updates of system softwares...the only 3 things that attracted ME...BUT YOU DON'T GET ATTRACTED..read all the reviews available at various forum, do proper researches and read the below if you have time :) cons: 1. You get less free RAM, game crashes again and again..for instance if you play asphalt8 on it, generally it starts the race and then crashes, but many times when it is not in mood it will crash the time you hit the start race button,, if it can not hold these kind of games then for what 1GB RAM is meant for, even Moto E is better than it in this section 2. heats up on 15 minutes continues use, whether it s gaming or any other app or just using the internet; 3. not meant for app lovers; if you install a lots of different app on the phone, this phone is strictly not for you, it onlly allows you to install upto 15-17 app, that too just basic apps not the heavy ones.... 4. every ones calling it cheaper nexus 5, YES it is cheaper but NOWHERE near NEXUS 5, in fact no where near CHota-Puraana moto G.... 5. another app crashing instance is of the PLAYmusic and man it is a major one, you scroll down at a certain speed and it crashes, you search for some random song and it crashes...the best developed music app certified by google crashes in such a great fashion....hail MOTO, Hail Flipkart and Hail hittttler, no offence :D buy it regret it feel free to curse the motorola and Flipkart (y) Statutaory warning: kisi ki kahi-suni baaton pe na jaayein, apna paisa kharch kare, pehle istemaal karein fir wishawas karein...",

The phone is fast but not that suited for multitasking given its 1 gb ram limitation. you cannot multitask running a game. The camera clicks beautiful photos and the slo mo video recordings are fun to look at. the build quality is top notch, the people who know about moto g would be the only ones guessing this device's price right.

Lovely to hold , carry and dispay. The UI is just awesome folks. The rich interface, user friendly UI with cool presence, the logos, the colors, ease of access of any item - what not.. everything is fabulous. The speed , respose from web pages, desired output when performing something is truly responsive. Stunning display with updated Android platform helps me to stick to mobile always. The android syncs google account and helps you keep track of all notifications. very easy to install apps and so easy to access/run them. Dual SIM, front and rear camera with flash, good hardware specification and especially the solid body made me go crazy for it. This is truly unprecendented smartphone mobile below15k bucks. Would you like to experience the same? Then why late? Go and grab one for you and enjoy the beauty of smartphone only using Motoroll Moto G2.",

Cons: ram is some 850mb but its pretty enough for stock android, no USB cable provided, well thats it.. Finally its awesome phone ! can blindly go for it.. and many are reporting touch complaints in this reviews but it is false touch was snappy.. even better than Xperia Z.!",

I am happy to float the laggy buggy phone .. Dont know how my wife managed to use the s duos for more than an year such a crappy phone.. Coming to battery section I see it gives a decent battery backup for 1day with screen on time of 3hours with WiFi on for at least 16hours and with browsing time 2hours n a little of gaming . I heard a lot of battery issues with moto g 2nd gen.. But it doesn't seem to be in my case.. browsing net..

And after searching for a month I finally decided to go for MOTO G(2nd Gen).The following are the pros and cons as well as the reality of this phone. Reality: 1.850 mb is the actual ram available 2.12.90 is the actual storage available.out of which 1gb is already occupied the pre-installed apps and system data. 2.It does have matte look which make it quite different and decent from most of 5 inch phones. 3.Charger is non-detachable.It doesn't come with data cable. Pros: 1.A very good IPS 720p display. 2.Good quality camera.both rear and front. 3.OTG functionality.You can mount most of usb drives like pendrives,mouse and mini keyboard. 4.Dual sim.micro only. 5.Ability to play many of large apps and games. 6.Antutu rating around 18000. 7.Android 4.4.4 which can be upgraded to android L. 8.Capacitive touch 9.Clear call receiving and making. 10.Dual and louder speaker Cons: 1.Doesn't come with pre installed file manager app. 2.Sound get distorted at high volume and sound quality both in earphone and speaker is average. 3.Sometimes sim is not detected. 4.Only high quality gamepad are recognised by OTG not any simple gamepad",

Till now I have not got any problem with the service. Only I want to include that battery time is less as expected when wi-fi or data connection is kept on. A great experince with moto g. Secondly, the delivery system (mainly the customer support of bluedart) is very very poor.So, a kind request to you to look after it.",

The camera quality is not as good as sony or samsung. The pictures look real as they are and do not add extra effect as we see inexperia or samsung(have experimented on it). The secondary camera is really good no doubts about it. battery backup is fare. With rigorous use it will die out faster as is the feature with all smartphones.But with average use it lasts for a day.yes one thing i found surprising was there was no file manager application to see the contents of the extrnal card. But that is compensated with a file manager app from google play.",

I was immediately let down after first boot as the display had a blue line on its left side. other than that the phone was exceptional. hence I requested a replacement an received the replacement the next day of my request. Was happy with Flipkart CS and was happy to see the display was okay after first boot. But wen i tried to insert my sim card after initial charging there was another problem. the sim keeps coming out as it doesnt lock in the slot. was disappointed again as i cant use it as a phone but just as a media player. Both sim slot had the problem. I again requested a return. and after 2 days a sweet voice from flipkart told me she'll refund my money. I objected as it was a phone i needed. And after a lot of persuation she agreed to send a replacement. I received my third handset on 20th oct and wen i checked it also had the same problem. the sims wont lock. I'm otherwise happy with the set and i'd desperately like to keep the phone. But I'm afraid to order a replacement again as it may have worse faults. I'm really disappointed with Quality assurance of both Flipkart & Motorola. Do u think you can sell any crap to us customers? (two stars are for the prompt delivery & CS and 1 for the phone. the phone will get 2 more if i was able to insert a sim and use it as a phone)",

Android 4.4.4 runs butter smooth on the device and i have faced no lags during the 1 week that iv been using the phone. The battery issue is genuine. but nothing is wrong with the battery. It only needs to calibrate to display the proper battery percentage. So a couple of complete recycles of the battery should do the trick. I drained the battery full then charged it 100% and did this two times..now i have no issues with the battery..it lasts 1 full day and still has about 25% remaining. For the downsides.. a) it gets pretty warm near the camera while playing demanding games..even the screen gets hot while playing fruit ninja..something that also used to occur on my lumia 720. b) The ram could have been 1.5gb...and 360 security almost always shows about 70% used..but considering the device never lags i guess the 1 gb of ram does its job. c) i do wish the battery was removable but most phones are coming with non removable ones so that is fine. Apart from these i really have not faced any issues with it..and its quite a delight to use the phone. However with the likes of sony e3, lumia 730 and galaxy prime emerging into the scene i believe moto g 2nd gen faces a tough competition. It just goes to show no device can remain in the limelight for too long in this hugely advancing tech market.",

I've already used Moto G (1st Gen) and just received this Moto G (2nd Gen) 2 weeks ago. Pros.: -Look and Design is very good. Nice carve shape & Smooth backside. -5\" HD Display,Nice,Fast, Crisp and Vivid. -The front Dual speakers are awesome, Loud n Clear, -Call quality is also nice it has 2 mics with Noise Cancellation (works fine) -No network problem in this model so far. - 8 MP main camera & 2 MP front. It takes amazing pictures so far both indoors and outdoors. -micro SD slot up to 32GB (great inclusion) -lag free latest Android 4.4.4 (kitkat) -Good processor & graphic speed You can play most of high end games. Multitasking is also very smooth -Wifi connectivity is good works nice. Con's -Video camera is good but not great. Please put \"Image Stabilization\" in next edition. -Battery performance is average. -Charger getting heated while doing charging. -Device also getting more heated with back covers. -Headphones are not good...Cheap and useless for me. -Data cable for is an essential need which can be fulfilled. -Some reflected lines you can clearly see in the screen on sunlight. This feel uncomfortable to see anything in device's screen on sunlight. At last great job Flipkart u have delivered my phone much earlier than I expected. Completely satisfied with the delivery service (depend on seller) and packing.",

I have been recommending the phone to my friends and family since I bought my first Moto G (2nd Gen). Of course its not a perfect phone, but for the people who are looking for a good phone within INR 15,000.00, this is the best choice. Highly recommended.",

The design and looks are very elegant. 2. Display is very good. 3. Performance is smooth. Haven\u2019t had a hitch till now. One reason could be because of the basic android version. One down side for that is very limited settings. For Samsung users it could be a trouble initially, but once you get used to you don\u2019t find it bad at all. 4. Camera is decent if not extraordinary. 5. About the battery. When I recharged it for the first time it got heated up. But then on no heat issues till now. Battery life is not very great, but manageable. Overall for 13000 I would say it\u2019s a good buy.",

Also there is a noise in the call audio, couldn't talk longer on this phone. I have raised return request to Flipkart to send the non-defective device. Hopefully will get it replaced!!.

I was not getting any type updation (delivery status) before 29th sep. So, poor delivery service. 1. Screen: Nice,Fast, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand. 2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine. 3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity. 4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :) 5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good. 6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option. 7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses! Overall i can say Moto G2 phone is awesome in this Range. I am satisfied with this Phone. Thanxs 2 all.",

No doubt the hardware of the phone is quite enough fast but Software is very very poor. Now I came to understand the failure of Mortrola and Nokia in the Market. The worst policies of the company have dropped them on the floor. In Moto G you cannot assign a different ringtone or wallpaper on different sim. You cannot set default sim to call. Every time you need to select the sim for calling. You cannot block a person from calling. If you upload a third party ringtone it does not repeat at all. It rings once only and gets mute. So many futures are quite missing if we compare with samsung. While attaching a photograph with contact you cannot crop the photo even. While display on calling photo is not being displayed properly. The worst software. I ready to return it with loss of Rs. 1000 or more.",

Have been using the device for the last two days. The device is good in looks, camera is very good, no lag, Apps run smooth. Video quality is OK, though not excellent, weight of the device could have been reduced, gets slightly heated up while on Skype video call, but no complaints about call quality. Data cable for transferring files from computer is an essential need which can be fulfilled. Over all a Great Product for the price and additional discount of 10% on SBI Debit cards is an icing on the cake!",

Wifi and internet 3g connectivity is not up to the mark. My laptop connectivity is better. display quality is very good. But the mobile look is not so great as it appears on the HD screen. It looks similar to samsung duos. Any how I bought a black flip cover for this ear phone which comes with in the box is not so good. So I cannot comment the sound quality and voice reception quality. I am planning to buy a new head set. Overall I am enjoying with this product.",

Before giving it to my dad i used this phone for one week. Pros 1. Battery life is very good. Even while playing asphalt 8 the percentage of battery drained was fare less. 2. It doesn't need 2 gb ram. It was very efficient while multitasking. 3. The video quality is amazing. 4. Speakers are in front. 5. Notifications are loud which is very important 6. Call quality is absolutely awesome. You don' t need to put the phone on your ear. cons 1. As everyone I was expecting 2Gb ram. 2. Battery capacity could be more. I will recommend you to buy this phone. This phone has more than enough features available that are enough for lot of people. One thing that I noticed is if you go to a mobile shop and ask for a moto phone (that happens nothing to laugh about) they mock moto phone. My dad was told the android is not genuine and all kind of sale pitch they could have thrown. Please don't listen to them. This is a google phone and you know google is god.",

However, once I finished all the settings and tried to restart, the phone conked off and does not turn back on. Placed a request for a replacement request with Flipkart, but I must say I am very disappointed with the post sales support. They need a verification call to be completed before they can process the replacement and have been waiting for the phone to ring since the last 3 days. I have for now got myself an expensive paper weight.",

Yesterday onwards, 19th & 20th Oct, I noted that i'm not able to hear what the other person is saying irrespective of which sim i'm making/receiving the call. the other end person called me 4-5 times. i called him back 3-4 times. same issue.Only solution i found was to reboot which fixes it for some time. Then issue comes back. it has occurred now for 4 times in 2 days. Today i called up my uncle to know his feedback and i'm anxious to hear that he's facing the same issue. Are any others facing this issue? i'm planning for a refund if the issue is persisting.",

Pros: - Big screen with good resolution. - camera is great - includes many google inbuilt apps - 1 gb ram is sufficient if you are not a terrific gamer - light weight - battery backup is sufficient Cons: - Takes upto 2-3 hrs to get fully charged - Battery gets drained faster is data is on - gets i little bit of hot if used continuously for a long time Overall i would like to say that Moto G 2nd gen is a good mobile in the price, if your budget is that much. otherwise you can get some mobiles with same features at a very low cost but those may be like china mobiles and moto g 2 is a branded phone so those who have a good budget upto 13 k i would recommend them all to buy a moto g 2 because this is a good company phone and you can rely on it rather than buying china material like (xiomi mi3, red mi, asus).

I tried removing 2 games to see if it was causing any issues but it did not resolve the problem. Then finally I factory reset the phone, this too did not resolve the problem of hanging. It hangs for few minutes making the phone totally unusable. I checked with some of my office colleagues & they too faced the same problem with Moto G(2nd Gen) & they got it replaced. Was not expecting this from Moto, after all there were good reviews from all for this model.",

            "comment": "I am happy to receive the mobile from flipkart before the shipping date they initially mentioned. As I have gifted this phone to my mother I am happy it came before diwali. Flipkart is great!!! I ordered this product on big billion day with exchange offer but due to some technical glitch the price didn't reduced when during checkout, I tried 7-8 times but was unable to get the discount, however I ordered the phone and 2-3 days later i received a call from flipkart who said they apologize for the cause and provided me a discount of Rs. 1000/- due to inconvenience caused which actually make me happy. Now regarding the phone everything is good and the quality is what you expect from 20-25K phone. The performance of the phone is good nice proportions and white color looks killer in your hands. All the specifications indicate a great product which indeed it is. The main thing is the camera which i would like to discuss as it cannot be only specified my megapixels but rather needs a description. Pros: 1. First of all the camera has a good resolution and images are less noisy if viewed on a laptop screen. 2. Great performance of camera even in low light, which I didn't expected at this price point. A great camera for indoor photographs. ( for example the camera of MOTO G2 is better than Sony Xperia L which my wife uses) 2. Colors are natural and does not gives any artificial effect and the overall result is very appealing to eyes. Cons: 1. One minute drawback with the camera is that your hands need to be very sturdy for a perfect shot ( i guess there is no optical stabilization). As I use Nokia lumia 720 I am spoiled :) by the great camera performance which i have seen either in lumia or some high end phones like nexus (apprx. 30-35K). however one can download google camera app for a slightly better camera performance. 2. Front camera is average and not verry good. In all I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a tight budget constraint (i would say best phone under Rs. 20,000/-), instead of going to category B brands MOTOROLA gives a great package which ticks all the essentials + some extras.",

MotoG 2nd gen is a good buy at this price. it sure has a little extra in every specification as compared to motoG1. But moto g2 sure does provide much extra at that 1k price in case. Yes the phone with a bigger screen now feels little big when compared to motog 1. Even the speakers at front helps in case you have left the phone or bed. but the sound is not loud enough moreover sounds tend to break off sometimes. In short even after the more things provided by moto it still isnt as satisfactory as the 1st gen G. its an overall good phone a that pricepoint",

CONS Find nothing such in a phone .....but Accesories of this are not to good...charger heats up very soon also the phone take too ,much time in charging( 3-4 h) .... the worse thing of this phone is it's earphone...By seeing them u will feel that it will not costs more than 100rs... made with cheap quality..... IT SEEMS THAT MOTOROLA HAS PUT ALL THE EFFORTS ON THEIR PHONE ... NOT ON ACCESSORIES ... FINAL VERDICT --- AFFORDABLE ,1000 TIMES BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS (samsung,sony,htc) IN PRICE, LOOKS, PERFORMANCE etc... rating- 5/5( GO THROUGH IT )",

Good Point in the phone is its look, performance and price. Take it, You can buy some good earphones and charging cable to make it perfect.......",

Just that it's not comfortable putting it in jeans and travelling or driving. I'm just making a point and not complaining. Flipkart service was pathetic this time and it took them 9 days to deliver despite raising so many request through mail n phone. I needed the phone urgently n they delivered it a day late.

And as to consider processor performance and gaming , ...... the moto g 2nd gen works smooth without any lags as much of my notice and most of the games work that too on highest graphics configuration..... Also considering the battery of the phone...... it gives you decent battery life , which wont leave you much disappointed unless you have high hopes from a 13k phone.......... on medium usage it might survive for a day and on high usage the battery fades away within 10 to 12 hours or less...... also for the first 2 days i notice that the signals totally dropped in between and after a minute or two it would come back..... but later the problem got fixed by itself ......... Also .....not to forget the stereo speakers give a loud and clear performance without any noise or anything of that sort.......... Anyways in short .... if you want all the best features in a smartfone at this range.... I suggest you better go for it..!",

Was little dissatisfied with the Battery backup originally and requested for an exchange but found after regular use and charges for 15-20 days the battery now indeed has a full day back up after moderate use. 5 inch HD display give a great experience watching movies and playing games. Played high graphics games with no lags. So it you are looking for a brand phone with exceptional price. purchase the phone with your eyes closed.",

Also required Removal battary in case of demage. 3.Not have a proper cover for safety. 4. Need any insurance plan associated with it. Instead of this phone is good,best processor,WiFi clears show if any problem in Network,disappointed with Lollipop view is not good as 4.4. version .

Specially the pictures that I was able to take from my 720 were unbelievable so the 18k were well spent keeping in mind the fluidity of Windows Phone OS. The 720 is now outdated but still works as smooth as any phone but I had to get a phone which had better specs, was fluid and could take decent photos if not better. And after reading hundreds of reviews and watching around 20-30 videos I had to pick up this phone. Never was a fan of customized android. Coming to the Moto G. 1. The stabilty of stock android and lollipop which came preinstalled is amazing. I have faced minor hiccups only when I have alot of apps open in the background and multitaking between heavy apps. Still the issues are rare and the phone is a charm when it comes to fluidity. -1 2. Battery is almost the same as 720 which had 2000 Mah, where as here its 100 more. You cant expect an android to give you 2 days like my Windows Phone but I am okay which the backup that lollipop provides. Goes easily for a full day on normal use, charging speed is lower but gets full in 4 hours. -1 3. Build is smooth and the phone in no way looks cheap and has a rubber feel in the black model. Though gripping it can be uneasy as it as thin edges and a 5 inch is a big size anyway. It all depends on how carefully you hold it.- 0.5 4. The photos taken were decent in day light and the speed was good in capturing. In low light the pictures could have been better. Frankly I already knew this model was not meant to take best photos. -0.5 5. I missed the ability to double tap to wake which is present on WP. and also the people Hub which includes smart linking of social contacts with phone number thus providing social feeds for each contact. That also meant the persons Facebook picture gets auto added to the contact profile. I did find the sync.me app to do this. 6. Applications and games running absolutely fine and you can multitask without issues. Resuming is fast if you don't have huge games installed. Smooth keeping in mind it has only 1 Gb ram. - 1 I will add an additional star for the price of the product keeping in mind the brand and the fact that lollipop came installed and without any hiccups or bugs. A must get under 15K INR if you like stock android.",

I would recommend any buyer looking for a phone in this range should go for Moto G or HTC Desire 616.",

Initial order, I got the phone which got switched off and never turned on in one day. I reported to flipkart and got the replacement for the same. New one is working properly. Pros: 1. Front and back camera quality (both for photo and video) excellent. 2. speed increases after lollipop update. 3. notifications are fine after lollipop udpate. 4. speakers sound is good. 5. battery backup is good if not using any internet. Cons: 1. Little big that we cannot hold with single hand and operate. While with moto E we can. 2. Network problem. Internet 3G services doesn't work properly. It requires huge signal area to get 3G internet. Whereas my samsung galaxy tab 2 able to receive 3G signals at the same place. 3. Charging the phone takes a lot of time. I figured that the problem is with the charger because when I use the samsung's charger for this phone it charges very quickly. 4. speaker quality on high volume is not good. 5. sometimes playing games like subway surfer degrades the performance for sometime. 6. RAM is not enough for this phone. atleast 2GB should be there. 7. battery drains quickly on continuous usage of internet less than 12 hrs. For any other information kindly comment I will get back to you.",

Almost as sturdy as old nokia phones in terms of basic call/msg functionality and more smart & fast that Samsung smart phone that I owned before. Moto is the way to go in smart phone space - love it! Biggest Advantage of MotoG after 8 months of using the phone: It's agile & fast & exteremly reliable. Good voice & smart functionalities. I would give an arm & a leg as they say to get a good performance smart mobile after I was bugged by my 'slow as snail samsung' that used to hang every now and then to the extent that I was afraid the set will be of no use even in emergencies that it'll take about 2-3mins for me to even do simplest stuff like make a call or send an sms! After Samsung experience, MotoG is like a dream. I love the set for basics & 'smarts' too! Small dsiadvantage: To prewarn those of us who are going to get their 1st ever Moto, wanted to add a word of warning on what I initially missed on my MotoiG i.e. those simple built in samsung apps like File Manager, Voice Recorder (even the Weather Widget on 'desktop' in fact:-) etc on MotoG which I had got used to on my previous 'slower than snail Samsung' set. Found these apps easily downloadable from Playstore (File Manager app, Super Voice Recorder app, The Weather Channel etc) so that issue was solved in a month. Can appreciate the pure android packaging of Motorola however probably one of the reasons for it's speed & reliability so this was a petty issue in final reckoning. Verdict: Will surely recommend MotoG smart phone to my friends (it was recommended to e by a gadget guru friend in the first place when I was battling with the slllooowww past samsung mobile)",

I raised a question for the reason because i used this mobile for just couple of days. They said \" we don't know about that we will send this moto g 2 to another Moto service center and it will take 15 to 20 business days. I don't why they asked that much days.Finally i collected my mobile on march 12th.Now i tried to charge my mobile but it is not charging. See how bad it is which is delivered by FILPKART. After that i called filpkart executive they again told to visit service center. Please don't purchase this mobile from filpkart.There is no guarantee on this MOTO G 2 in flipkart.Very very very bad product which i got from FILPKART.",

And now the initial impressions on the device itself after thoroughly using it for around 7-8 hrs, the phone delivers what it promises, Class, sturdiness, latest OS (Lollipop), camera features, battery backup (haven't tested the battery thou).But, let's see how Moto G performs against equally strong contenders in the market and within this price range. But overall, feel somewhat confident that this device's gonna last for a very long time in my kind of hands. FLIPKART'S AWESOME BTW!!!.. :)",

It seemed like a luck of draw that I would receive a not-so-problematic device. I almost cancelled my order but then thought, meh. It was delivered within 24 hours to me, that is clearly a plus point for flipkart. Not for the phone (all those people out there who rate a product low because flipkart messed up your delivery). I have to say the first night I used it, it seemed like that I received a defective piece, with poor earphone volume, poor speaker volume and a really bad battery. And the metal strip almost burned my ear. If that had gone for two-three more days, I would have just returned the damn thing. However, it's been almost 10 days now and the battery is a powerhouse, I have to say. I'm getting a ~14-15 hours battery backup on an all-time-3G, all-syncs-on, ~1 hour web browsing and IM. And it stays at a working temperature of 30-35 C. The screen performs unexpectedly well in even very bright sunlight. As far as that goes, I'm having almost the same experience as my previous lumia 720 (which used to give me battery backup of ~20-22 hours though. Eh, well!) As of now, I am having no issues with calling (both cellular and voip) although the sound system could've been made a bit more better. But it works, no static, no unexpected drops, no so-called hissing noise. The camera is okay. I didn't expect the front camera to be good but it actually turned out to be really good. However, although it's true for almost any phone, cameras in Nokia Lumia work better even when they are of less resolution. My lumia 720's 6.7MP worked better than this one's 8MP. But don't let a not-so-good camera stop you from buying this. I'm not going to state the obvious android issues and advantages. I don't do heavy gaming or anything, so I don't know whether the RAM is enough. My opinion: If you want to stick to ~12-14k, buy this one. Otherwise shell out a few more bucks and get a One Plus One.",

I reported to them promptly on the same day but they denied to repair the phone under warranty and demanded Rs 6495/-. I intimated this problem to flipkart also and they took the matter but later they also confirmed that motorola is not ready to give warranty. I had a chat with Vurri Balraj of Motorola who asked to forward the screen shot. I a forwarded the same along with invoice raised by flipkart. My claim is that the reason of malfunctioning is certainly not due to any mishandling as the phone has not got a single scratch on its body which is ample prove that phone has been handled very carefully. they allotted me Customer Reference number :150309-009128 and Motorola E-Mail Team member Arunjyothi had a talk. She intimated that she is forwarding the case to higher level so that they might help in any possible way. But they send me a mail on 11.03.15 that they have not heard from me concerning my request for support in the 48 hours since they sent you a response. Consequently, they have changed the status of my question to Solved. This is the way motorola is cheating customer. Pl do not but any motortola product if you want to live peacefully",

I am using this phone from last one and half month. You get everything in this phone what a true Android can offer, talking about product specification, camera, which is better than Sony but one point less than Apple, good video recording similar to Sony best smartphone, better screen resolution relative to any other smartphone except Iphone. NO problem of mobile hang, But the time when you upgrade the Phone to Lollypop, the phone become unresponsive several times, phone battery backup lowers and the mobile internet dead and conjures on some occasions and even if you have to made important calls the phone love to be in unresponsive mode. So buyers are requested to not to upgrade to Lollypop, and also be apprised that i have not downloaded anything on my phone neither i have watched any porn or AV sites which could make phone unresponsive. Although, despite of above cons, still phone is extremely good in this price segment.",

            "comment": "Overall, I liked this phone for its value for money and bought it about 2 months back. I have seen many friends buy the same phone and having a jolly time with it. I guess it boils down to luck, or is it lack of quality control, but anyway the fact of the matter is the display conked off just like that. It just stopped displaying anything except some red and blue lines. So, here is the thing. I looked up the nearest authorized service center in Bangalore (thats where I live), one \"Pramanik Mobile Service Zone\" in Jayanagar. The guys there told me I have to replace my display. Ok, I thought it is a matter of few days, if not few hours. To my utter shock, even after waiting for 2 weeks, no one called up. So, I contacted the service center and I was told there was scarcity of parts! I called up Motorola customer care and they assured me the phone would be repaired in a week. Naturally, when I did not get any update at the end of the 3rd week, I was pretty upset. I sent a complaint to motorola customer care again (contacting the service center was useless as they kept saying there were no parts), and again I got an assurance that the issue has been raised to \"priority 1\" and someone would contact me within 24 hours to resolve the issue. Guess what, no one contacted (which, by this time, I have come to expect from Motorola). After one more heated mail to Motorola and after 24 days of first giving my phone, I finally got a call from the service center that the phone is repaired!! Moral of the story: Buying Motorola gives you value for money, but pray nothing goes wrong because the service is shit!",

However with the latest software update its gotten sloppy and a bit slow. But I suppose that it is only a matter of time until Google gets that worked out. Another point that I would like to bring out is the fact that I had had to get this phone replaced twice before I got a piece that I could use properly. The first one had some performance issues (this is was before I updated to lollipop), and the second one had display problems. Getting it exchanged once was a pain, not to mention doing it another time. Although getting to the piece I am currently using was extremely harrowing to say the least, I am satisfied with what I ended up with after it all to say the least. So kudos to Motorola! Keep up the good work! P.S: Thank you for upping the camera a notch. It has become much better now.",

If u try to bend very little you can see touch points on screen, even if you didn't do that. Thousands of Moto Series has gone for screen change.

The build quality of this piece was great compared to mine, which now suffers from a very receded power button (which is incredibly hard to press). It's amazing for its price (though better phones have been launched in this range since). Lollipop has improved its performance. One thing I wish Motorola could provide, is the level of service which they provide in the US. Getting a replacement after 30 days from Motorola (due to manufacturing defects/problems which started appearing after 30 days) is nearly impossible, and the service centre is near useless. Calls to Moto and Flipkart about this are also useless. I am now left to use the phone with the power button hanging by a thread and with no hope of it getting fixed. All in all, if you are lucky enough to get a good sturdy piece, then the experience is amazing.",

After the Lollipop update, the phone works even better, with battery life extended by hours. Everything is spiffy, clean and quick, just what I need for an everyday phone. It helps that the design is pretty sturdy and can take a beating (not that I recommend that). After three months of use, I am yet to see unsightly scratches on the screen. And no, I do not use a protective film or case of any kind. Overall, a great, everyday phone that has and does everything you need.",

Excellent service by Flipkart, got it delivered in one day (without availing the 90 rs/- service :-) ) If you are a user who just goes about using the phone for chatting, FB, regular calls, and music. This is the best buy. But, this phone surprised me with its HD display and the video rendering capability. I played videos using youtube, mostly 1080p videos, they looked awesome on this display. You will love to watch movies from this phone for sure. This phone is upgrade-able to Android Lollypop version, once this upgrade is done, you will like the phone even better. Lollypop's UI is brilliant!! Headphones are good to make calls, but lacks the effect that you would be expecting while listening to music and watching movies.",

Its sound quality is exceptional . That's all .Frankly go for the moto G2 for after sale services also. The only con in this phone is the very average battery life. Overall very much satisfied with this phone for a price and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Thursday.",

Got the phone on time and in good packaging moreover I got instant lollipop update as soon as I booted the device. After updating to 5.0 lollipop my phone started to hang and battery drained like anything even after switching off all battery hogging toggles. Call reception was bad on both airtel and idea, frequent call drops and many times the other party could not hear my voice. Screen is not great as in resolution, if watched for long it strains your eyes. Last but not least battery charging took around 4 hrs which I think is too much to wait. There can be a possibility that I got a defective product but even the replaced piece was bad so I guess its about quality issue as two phones cannot be bad without reasons. I was completely dissatisfied with this phone. As for others buy it only if ur tired of the regular Samsung UI. I have written my review based on my own experience and I dont intend to offend anyone.",

Its looks a fabulous to hold it in hand, it feels very easy to handle it, it doesn't slips from hand. Camera quality and battery performance remains the same as my previous phone, its average i would say. The upgraded lollipop gives this phone an extra added advantage to this phone. I would recommend Motorola to put up a 13MP camera to their next gen of moto. Overall the phone is good, i would recommend this phone for those who wants durable and budget phone and for people who wants latest software.",

I don't even have too many apps installed. The phone crashes and hangs very frequently (almost for every 5 minutes that you use) I bought this because of positive feedback but that doesn't seem to be the case. Don't know if the product I've received is not good enough or the phone in general is crappy. The former seems to be a possibility. All in all - quite disappointed with the product Flipkart!! I think there's now a compromise between price and quality finally.",

It runs on stock Android, hence no bloatware Gets updates just after the NEXUS mobiles get them, hence Cool Has expandable memory, which the NEXUS series don't Has a decent battery life which is quite comparable with a NEXUS (About a Day with Heavy usage) Even looks like the newly launched NEXUS 6 ;-) (Just a little small though) At this price and specs this mobile is a overall good performer and is too good to own one!

Then i called to the flipkart customer care and they promise to replace the mobile. I also mention that the behavior of customer care executive is very good. They replaced the mobile on next day (1st march). Verdict: Flipkart is very good & there service is also very good. But the problem is the vendor who sell the product with Flipkart, they are no so good. Like \"WS Retail\". Flipkart Service 5 out of 5. Vendor (WS Retail) 1 out of 5.",

The glass/screen shattered. i was impressed with testing videos of Gorilla glass but in reality i was very disappointed with the glass. I doubt if it is a original Corning Gorilla Glass 3. I'm very disappointed. I went to Moto Service center they said they would charge me 6000 for the replacement of screen which is half the price of the phone. So THINK before you BUY. I've used other company phones like HTC One V, Samsung S3 which i dropped many times but they never broke. Moto fell for the first time and it broke. So Think before you Buy.",

The primary camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 8MP while the secondary is upgraded from 1.3MP to 2MP. The rest of the specs are the same as compared to the Moto G 1st Gen. Overall the build quality is great and the phone is very comfortable in one hand as well. The camera pictures are crisp and clear if you compare it with the other phones in the same range. The phone came with the Android 4.4.4 kitkat which has now been upgraded to the 5.0.2 Lollipop. The stock android performance is impeccable and runs smooth. Battery life is decent with the 2700mAh battery. Certainly my pick for the range of under 15k phones. 2 thumbs up for Flipkart and its lightning speed delivery!!!",

I have compared front cam of moto g 2014 with iphone 5, xperia z and note 3's front camera... there was not a big difference so if you are buying phone for camera than this is good option! and this phone has got nice stereo speakers which is surely gonna impress you! Here are some features of this phone which is enough to give you reason why you should buy this phone! - very nice display and speakers - different design, miles batter than samsung's almost same designed phones. - battery life is also okay, it's not that good. - waterproof layer coated! - phone doesn't gets hanged even when you are using more applications at once. If your budget is below 20,000. Then I strongly recommend you this phone!",

My friend bought the black piece that looks like a nexus device. So regarding looks it looks good in hands and good to hold. Though I dropped it once on a bus I scared to pick it up as I was expecting a broken screen but there was something for its protection, yes it was the Moto Flip cover. The flip cover looks too good with the phone. I'm saying it again it's too good. Regarding performance I was bit disappointed with the multitasking. 1GB RAM is seriously not enough. Make it 1.5GB and increase the price by 3k the phone will be still selling like garama garam pakodas in winter. Camera- download google camera and use it I am telling you, you are gona be surprised with the qualities of the photos even with the 2MP. I clicked all my farewell photos with it and the photos were much better than my Sony cybershot's 14MP camera. I will say it's a google phone that keeps you updated with time. Battery is pathetic with 3G data on but google works good with 2G data you have your whatsapp, google updates, Email and it lasts a day. That's it!",

I experienced the following issues... The phone came with Lollipop Version. here i am writing a genuine review guys seriously i have faced these problems. The phone has been restarting randomly. Lot of hotness can be found on screen when you keep it in pocket even with 15 minutes of calling. Phone hanged at times closing all apps and returning to home screen. You dont know, to which SIM a person is calling you ( 1st SIM or 2nd SIM ) You can't message an unknown number from the call log directly. you have to remember the number in your mind and type in message box to send message. No call blocking facility. The UI is not good at all, why should i install launchers?? UI lags in response. Calling & Messaging takes a lot of time to connect to other person even when using 3G. Flipkart people will tell to factory reset the phone so that it will come into good condition, but it din't. Flipkart dont want to refund my money, they just want to give replacement. I am highly upset with the device. One can go with Lumia 730 in this range which is quite fast and silky smooth OS.",

A lot of things was going on in my mind while the product had not been delivered. I was thinking if i had taken the right decision...will it feel cheap...how will be it's performance...and a lot of other things. I received the phone next day (thanks to flipkart for the 1 day guarantee service). As soon as I opened the box and took it in my hands...i was like waaaaaaw.....amazing... A well built phone...sturdy...nice grip...curvy edges... Now it was time to test the phone. I simply downloaded all the applications that i used on my other phones and started using all of them...switching between them was flawless...the phone didn't lagged even for once. Front camera is too good for making video calls...it captures every details and the video looks realistic on the receiving device. Playing videos...you will feel like if you are watching it on a LED...display is very clear...and sound quality is also very good, much louder and still clear than my iPhone and samsungs (thanks to the dual front speakers). I rarely use the phone for taking photos so camera is not a concern for me...but after seeing some of the shots i captured...it seemed very good...specially autofocus is very good. The camera features panorama mode continuous shots (just keep tapping). You also get to capture 720p HD video and 720p slow motion video. Battery backup is also very good...I am using it since 9 am today and doing all sort of things(played games, watched videos, made video calls, browsing, listening songs online,checked mails) and still i am having 30% battery left. I ordered this along with original Moto flip cover and 32GB Class 10 sandisk ultra memory card. With the flip cover the phone looks much beautiful than naked...;p. Along with the 32GB memory card this has become a beast in terms of storage (combined u will get massive 42 GB for ur use.) I was reading other user's review also and some of them had mentioned that charger is getting hot like a rock...but i haven't felt it yet...It's been continuously plugged in since friday night charging my other phones as well...i will suggest they better check there electrical connections (use with extension boards which removes spike) In simple words i will say...just go for it...you will love it",

Great in looks, the MOTO G offers you a very distinct benefit, the Android Lollipop Upgrade which will make jealous to any other user, who understands technology. Everything working great on the phone. No need to expand memory unless you use your phone for watching movies!!! The only thing that I found less is the RAM(1 GB). With 16GB internal you can install almost anything everything in the Playstore, but the RAM limits the usage... Overall Suggestion based on Experience: BUY!! :) ;)",

If i am using 3g continuously i may have to charge phone for 2 time or may be 3 times. This is only thing which looks irritating to me. One last thing is the charging. Charging phone taking so much time min. 3 hour to get full charge. Due to all this i will be able to give 3 stars only. If you can overcome all this issue then this is perfect. I love it.",

One down is that there is no battery percentage shower..so we have to download apps for that.And also to set a ringtone other than the default is difficult.It wont get set.At last i had to copy my ringtones from my sdcard onto the phone memory to get this thing setted up. RAM also i have like 300MB free. Audio is in damn good quality through the 3.5m jack.Front facing speakers are also a plus and loud too. One thing about Moto G2 is that there is something wrong in some of this products recieved...sometimes customer get an awsm moto g2 or sometimes bad ones too...so its just basically luck and am LUCKY!!",

It looks OK on the phone's screen though. Also it does not have image stabilization which creates a bad image with even a small shake. I loved the earlier HTC phone's camera. HTC have the best camera even better than the iPhone in my opinion. Also the phone's call volume is too low even at its maximum volume and I would not say it is very clear. Quality on the other ends seems to be fine. I have an iPhone 4 and its call quality is far better and crystal clear given its noise cancellation features. The phone's screen also does not instantly turn on / off when I move it to be ear when taking / completing the call - guess it could be due to the proximity sensor lag and the bigger size.",

Immediately I called flipkart and they assured me that they will replace the order and I will get my phone, and they are regret about the inconvenience. 4.)

Pros of the phone: Nice screen. inbuilt 16gb extendable upto 32gb amazing 8 mp cam Lollipop update Free flipcover :) Cons: Battery should have been a bit more better, 2070 mAH for 5\" screen is bad. Hardly stays for a day. My advice: If you r a travelling kind of person then the battery is not that great. Will surely have to carry a powerbank with you. But other than that the phone is just amazing!!! Go for it!! Cheers!",

Another problem, since I did not have a choice i gave it for repairs, the period to get the replacement is 15 days!!! This is because the Service centre does not have enough stock and requested me to publish everywhere that Motorola sends them enough stock so that they can service easily",

Because none of that changes the fact that the Moto G is still the best budget smartphone you can buy today. Using the thing isn't as revelatory an experience as firing up the new Moto X was, but Motorola's long list of seemingly modest improvements",

Cons: Covers are damn expensive ( gun without bullet), no nice music player , headphone are not great. Lookout for market ,Samsung is gaining in with its price cut. Motorola is likely to do the same.

Moto G is a pretty neat device, and the Lollipop update was very fast (less than 5 minutes to download and another 10-odd minutes to install). The phone holds up very well against Lollipop, the touch is pretty responsive and the display is genuinely nice. The stock Anroid with next to nothing third-party apps helps the phone significantly compared to other devices available in this price range. My only fear -- and piece of criticism -- is the back cover. It's a task to open the back panel and insert the memory and sim cards, even though the manual says \"don't be afraid to use a little muscle\" All in all, you've a happy customer.",

Like in mid of texting, the screen blinks off all of a sudden.I learnt that after a power restart, it works fine temporarily. But not sure of permanent solution.

While it's Android base provides a lot of cool features and apps, I am not happy with it's performance as a phone; it's primary function. Compared to my user experience with BB 9220: (a) it takes longer to complete calls, (annoying) (b) call drops are frequent, (very annoying), (c) it needs to be recharged* every day if you have Mobile Data ON (d) upgrade to Android 5.0.2 has worsened my user experience. *my calling pattern is light. In retrospect, I should have gotten the BB 9220 repaired for Rs. 450 and saved myself Rs. 12549. Spend your hard earned money on other worthwhile things.",

The update to Android 5.0 lollipop was also seamless absolutely hassle-free. Decent battery backup, considering you are just using the device for phone, watsapp and some occasional video purposes. It can last without any problem for atleast 24 hours on a single charge. Cons: There was no USB cable in the box, which was a surprise!! Guys please include one. Hope the review helps.",

Flipkart delivered the product in a day as promised in good packaging. There are a lot of videos over the internet which tell that Moto G first variant is far better than this one in terms of build quality, display and sound, I negate these claims. The display ppi might be less than moto g 1st gen, it's still awesome in this one and the colors look bright and natural. Just loving it. Specs are already good and the feeling of Stock Android is just brilliant. I still did not upgraded it to Android L as I want to play with kitkat for sometime, but an upgrade to Android L would be better for sure as the new android version has performance upgrades as it has new 64-bit compiler. Camera is great for this price (8 MP), still not as good as lumia 730, but its too good for a normal user. The performance of the phone is awesome and even installing so many apps, no issue in the usage. Its been one day, and due to heavy usage, the phone lasted for 16 hours, with 14 % still remaining. I had ordered a Black Moto G and surprisingly, I got white ear phones and charger which I expected to be in black colors. The sad part is, no usb cable is provided along with the phone. Will update more soon after using it for a few more days.",

You guys are the best, but the Airtel 2 months 3G net offer that you have mentioned is not been given by the Airtel. They gave me that offer for the first month and when i asked about the second month they refused to give me the offer saying that i am not eligible for that offer. They blame flipkart for not giving the offer in the second month. Can you guys do some thing about this please.",

But i'm worried about only the signal catching. my Samsung and iphone is showing up good signal strength. Found one issue after the factory default reset. the keyboard is not working as expected. but after a reboot everything works perfect. The wall charging unit provided by Moto is heating like anything. so im using another wall charger.",

Most of the times the phone doesn't detect earphones and sounds still play on loudspeaker after connecting them. Even if you manage to somehow adjust it to work, just touch the pin or even the cable and BAM!!! Gone again! Will have to go through the pains of going to the Customer Care and get them replaced I suppose. The phone worked just fine with KitKat though shortcuts not so wisely chosen I'd say. And then came the biggest nightmare, Android L. It will be better than KitKat in future may be. But right now, its JUST NOT READY. Google should not have released it if it wasn't ready. So full of bugs, shortcuts and usage-wise dumber than ever. Here's a list of bugs or things I didn't like. The list is by no means exhaustive ;) There is NO \"Silent Mode\" it seems. The moment you turn the volume down, it will vibrate no matter what you settings are. It has a notification panel like usual, but still shows new notifications as popups at the top and couldn't find a way to disable it. If you want to toggle mobile data, you have to at least make 4 touches. Tried a few apps for shortcuts but the data toggle didn't seem to work. Google Now launcher simply looks \"UGLY\". The notification pull down is refreshing with a whole new transparent look but the moment you open app drawer, its got this white background with ugly big icons as if you've installed Windows on PC but forgot to install Video drivers. Weird! Battery graph makes it more difficult to understand how long it has been since last charge. When you press on the \"Phone\" icon, it takes considerable time to open up. Even if it doesn't, place a call from there to the last number or from Recents menu you'll notice a clear delay. Long touch the power button and the only option you get is Power Off. Not even restart, or sound profiles or anything. And it doesn't even ask for confirmation when you touch Power Off. Many animations are not smooth and clearly lag. For instance, the one when you close the app drawer. Lockscreen shortcuts cannot be customized anymore. It gives only 2 shortcuts by default, camera and phone. Now, a few icons and apps they've really changed to suit the new material design concept but the default sms app still has the same old icon which feels like the odd man out ;-) There are many more bugs which I couldn't think of while typing this review. In short, Android L is UNFINISHED. Yes, I did try factory reset too. Still no bugs solved. In fact, doesn't even ask for code or anything during factory reset also. So basically anyone who gets hold of my device can reset my phone. Wow! So useful! I personally didn't even like the new look much. I prefer the good old KitKat, but that's something which really depends on individual tastes.",

So i cant even pick the call. 3) Mobile network/Wifi connectivity both works only for some time. Most of the times, data connectivity is lost. 4) Phone automatically restarts!

            "comment": "hello, First of all there are a lot of reviews here that i feel are bullshit and dont tell the true story about the device. I have been using moto g 2nd gen for about nearly 5 months now. Here's what i feel about it. PROS 1. The best thing that separates it from other phones is that moto g2 provides stock android(pure android) just like the nexus. That's what is responsible for smooth performance. Its already got the lollipop update before other phones. 2. Snapdragon 400 with adreno 305 gpu is superior compared to octacore meditek processors as their gpu isn't powerful enough. The gaming is very good on moto g 2nd gen, i played asphalt 8 at high resolution and COD strike team without any lag. 3.Display is sharp . its a 720p display , good for watching movies and other tasks too 4. Front camera is excellent. the pics are of great quality 5.the design of the phone is stylish and ergonomic , its easy to use one handed despite large 5 inch screen. CONS 1. battery life is average , you gotta plug the charger before the day ends. Although after lollipop update there is slight improvement in battery life. I feel battery life is good for people with medium to less usage. 2. Rear cam of 8MP is average too. Its good for indoor shots and close up shots but not outside or distant shots or landscape etc. the level of detail is not satisfactory 3. Front cam is not wide enough to include more people but picture quality is good. 4. No 1080 video recording 5. 1gb ram is good for day to day tasks and gaming too but if you open too many apps and when u swtich between apps , the content or the app will reload . thats the drawback of 1 gb ram but still its good enough for maximum users i suppose 6. The front speakers are not good. not much loud , and at full volume the audio distorts a lot 7. Gorilla glass 3 is not un breakable , my screen broke after falling from my hands so use ur phone carefully. PS- Lollipop update brings great visuals to android but it has some bugs which will hopefully be fixed in next update",

The lack of support for 4G will be a deal-breaker for some, though. It isn't without its rivals, but if you're specifically looking for a budget dual-SIM Android phone, it's a good choice.",

Memory extention upto 32 GB allows enough capacity to store pictures,movie recordings etc. you can download a large number of games etc due to 16 GB internal memory. I am really extremely happy using Moto G(2nd Gen). I strongly recommend to select this Smart phone.",

            "comment": "I don't buy phones often neither do I talk about it as I feel there are better things to talk about. Prior to owning Moto G I bought the Moto E to \"taste\" vanilla android and it was such a fulfilling experience that I finally bought the G as well. This is sec gen and so it is BIG (for me, coming from E) Apps and everything looks way better than this than E. Both front and rear camera is decent enough for a 13k phone. I exchanged my old Lumia 525 and got the G for 10k. Sweet deal imo :) This phone is fast, you will love the big screen, battery is okay, don't go only by mah, there is more to what the manufacturer claims always! Lasts me 15 hours with average usage. I am keeping the E as back up phone and will use this as primary. G came with Lollypop. I am facing navigation/GPS locking issues with G but it is a known issue with Lollypop not Moto G. Unfortunately the Sim slot 1 on my G went kaput so FK is shipping me a new one. I should get it by tomorrow evening. All in all a very good \"best of all worlds\" phone for 13k.",

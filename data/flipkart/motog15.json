I bought Moto g 1st generation for rupees 14000/- and Moto g 2nd generation I bought for 11749/-. But specification are better for Moto g2 compare with Moto g1. So we are getting more features with less prices. Even flipkart delivery also awesome less than one day I got the product with any extra money... I love flipkart shopping. Thank flipkat and Motorola for your better and quality services.",

Guys be careful dont go for MOTO G2.] 1. Echo Problem [If someone call to you they will hear their voice to them. You wont get the echo] 2. Battery Drain [Within 4Hrs battery getting drained and mobile got switched off] 3. Automatically call disconnected continuously. So i requested for refund but Flipkart refused to give refund and they told we ill give a replacement for the mobile on 27 November 2014. The newly arrived product also have the same issues and again i called flipkart and requested for refund. They instructed me to go to the MOTO service center and get the \"JOB SHEET\" & \"DOA\" for refund. I visited the MOTO service center as usual they very not responsible with big fight with them got \"JOB SHEET\" & \"DOA\" then scanned those and send it to flipkart then only they refunded my money on 11 December 2014. This is a very bad experience i had.",

On monday I waited the whole day and tried to call at the given number to confirm if the delivery will be done, but there was no response and neither the courier boy contacted, I left office late expecting for a call back but all in vein. To my shock I receive a message at night that the since the delivery was attempted twice and couldnt be completed hence the order stands cancelled. when was the 2nd attempt made, can I get an explanation of it????? I wanted this to gift to someone and I am a regular shopper from Flipkart, and after this incident I will have to think before making any purchase from this site. Thankfully I opted for COD otherwise my money would have unnecessarily blocked as they would have given the credit to my wallet which means I have to use the money for shopping at this site only.",

The Moto G2 is the probably the best the best smart phone in this price range. It function good and its very smooth in use. Also the lolipop update are rolling out soon for Moto G2. 16 GB inbuilt and expandable memory upto 32 GB is the best feature all the phone should have. The 8 mp camera does the job very well and also you can download Google Camera for more features (if you are into photography and stuff). the front firing speakers are awesome and are very loud and clear (you will enjoy watching movies). The 5 inch HD display works good in broad day light (sunlight). The company claim that the phone is water resistant though I have not tested it (never will). Other features such as Motorola Migrate, Motorola Alert, Motorola Assist just make your contacts, photo,video...etc transfer easily and fast (once you figure out its easy). I would recommend you to go for it.",

I was directed by flipkart to one of the third party service agency for repair . I am not sure about the authenticity of the service provider. Flipkart is not providing the Motorola email id / phone number. Beware before you purchase any motorola mobile I submitted the device for motherboard change on 24-12-2014 to the authorised service provider as per their advise. The service provider said that that it will take a week to get the mother board, I am speaking to Motorola and the service person for the past 20 days and nothing is happening. There are conflicting versions from Motorola and the service provider regarding the service. I received a message from Motorola that the device has been repaired. But to my surprise, the service provider is saying that the mother board is yet to be received by them and it will take more time. When I spoke to motorola, they are not at all helpful. As on date i,e. 13-01-2015, I am yet to get the mobile back from the service provider. As such I request all the potential purchasers to think before placing any order on motorola mobile as the Motorola products are substandard and useless.",

Started switching off automatically and then restarting from 7th December. Tried Factory Reset but it was of no use. Placed a replace order. Got a new piece on 15 December. I must say Flipkart is very efficient and prompt in customer care. I checked the box as soon as I got the package and it was not tampered. Tried to insert the SIM card and it was not popping in (SIM card is fine. Tried it on other phones). So remember when you are buying this phone there is a very very good chance that you may receive not one but two faulty phones in a row. Still want to purchase this Phone ? Good Luck to you!!

Fed up of the backup.. and its not like its baatery is dead now from the day 1 its not giving the backup as expected, beside this camera quality is also not good. Its 8 MP camera is performing very less than that of samsung Grand 8 MP camera. rest build and design is good. but i suggest if u r looking for good batery and camera then do not go for it. I am giving 4 stars just for its looks and design.",

Then I requested for refund after a bad experience at Motorola service centre. Flipkart promptly responded to my concern and approved my refund. After sales service is very important whenever we invest on a smart phone. And my experience says samsung is the best in this regard.",

Performance is very good(even with only 1gb of ram) as this runs stock android(snapdragon 400 just makes things even better). The gorilla glass 3 protection makes it look premium and also provides protection against scratches(i.e. you don't need a screen protector). Also the screen contrast and color production is just great, it beats many of the 20k+ phones in this aspect. Overall this phone is just perfect for someone looking for a good display and a powerful performance phone in this price range.",

I have been using the phone for 20 days with almost 9 GB filled memory and 25 apps installed. Now the advantages: good screen clarity,smooth browsing experience of apps(but RAM uses around 500 MB without any running app),personalised care from motorola,lag free multitasking (though not equivalent to a 2gb r.a.m phone),upgradation to the lollipop 5.0,slim body-not edgy. Disadvantages: Battery backup is poor,speakers and earpiece not so good as the company claims- sound is hollow and shattered on high volume,earphones are of cheap quality(plastic make) but deliver good sound,no data cable in package. If the company increases it's talktime backup by upto 2 hours(it will increase internet browsing approx. upto 4 hours) in the next android update then it is a good product.",

Keyboard is great for texting and no issues even with the camera. It takes more than decent photos. However there a few issues. Battery is good with 20hrs backup with my medium to low usage. Drawbacks 1. Definitely a bit heavy 2. A full charge takes 4 hours which is slow 3. Earphones sound quality is terrible 4. With heavy use (with even multi apps left open) there is a lag and it definetly needs 2gb Ram.",

Phone doesn't lag in heavy games.Battery is average for a gamer but Decent for normal users. Motorola could have given 2GB Ram instead. Its an incremental update to Moto G not those revolutionary changes. Processor is the same. Could have improved. But though its my first Android, lucky to get this one.",

First the battery is lasting me as it was lasting when the phone was new. Second sometimes the speakers of the phone don't stop playing the track or audio even if I paused or stopped the audio then I have to cruelly shutdown the phone while it is playing the audio to stop the speakers. Third sometimes the earpiece speaker don't let me to hear my callers' voice as it doesn't provide any sound while on the call sometimes. Then also I have to shutdown the phone and restart it to make a call again. How irritating is that, Moto? The person on some forum suggested me to order for replacement. So you tell me Flipkart what should I do now?",

Pathetic Pathetic. I need to recharge at least thrice a day for continuous use. Forget continuous use, even when I dont use it gets drained as hell. I am a college student. I just keep it in my bag when I go to college at around 50-60pc charge. No mobile data, no wifi, I just check my phone is the breaks for about 10-15 seconds. When I come back from college(7 and half hours) I have 10-15 percent charge remaining ! Atrocious ! To top it all up, it need more than 3 hours to charge a hundred percent! Every 5 minutes of charge hardly increases battery by 2 percent. 2.) Camera Quality of pictures is superb. Hats off. Problem is the time it takes to focus! Almost 15-20 seconds. So if you want to take a really fast snap, you just cant do !",

Its your perfect buddy for running apps and being updated....TILL IT STOPS TO FUNCTION !! THE DARKER TRUTH.. AND CONTINUING FRUSTRATION I AM STILL FACING: My set stopped working on 5th dec (IN JUST 3MONTHS!!)it was not even switching on only motorola android was getting displayed with a lot of anger and frustration and still with a hope to get it right at moto service centrei wentther next day itself, i explained them the problem and they asked to submit my set after having the invoice to replace a part which was a manufacturing defect. Its been like 8-10 days and they still havent got the parts(thats what they say) and have given me only a receipt of their shop with no signatures and asked to wait for another couple of weeks .They have not even given another set for use for the time being.This case has happened with many more and i think if in a city like Mumbai they are not able to transport the parts for their valued customer (as they say while selling) then may god help those buying moto products from smaller cities. *No criticism for product features but durability and customer satisfaction ke mamle me its not a company to rely on\" #personal experience",

Motorola service center is asking me to pay 3000 for a slim slot, i am pretty sure that this is a huge amount for a sim slot repair. i am highly disappointed from Flipkart's and Motorola's service. I googled and found out that slim slot issue is a common problem with MotoG2, I will not recommend this phone.",

            "comment": "Before I start with my review I must state a fact that I was using Galaxy Grand Duos prior to buying Moto G2 & I had no intention to dump Grand before it got bricked due to an accidental short circuiting of the motherboard but that is an altogether different story\u2026let me continue with Moto G2. I ordered for a Moto G2 Black 16Gb on 7th Dec & the phone was delivered on 9th Dec. First of all the pros (Easy to point out as they are few) 1. Really smooth body finish\u2026phone looks are good & sleek 2. Good camera both front and back 3. Battery is not that bad as pointed in other reviews, I am getting almost 36-40 hours backup with pretty good usage of whatsapp, internet, gaming, music and other apps. Now the harsh truths about the phone: This phone looks so much half baked that it wonders me whether the developers had any thoughts about the people using it or they just rolled this phone out to take advantage of the Moto-Flipkart combo hype\u2026 1. The touch of this phone is hopeless\u2026the phone suddenly freezes in between and stops responding to any amount of touch, then suddenly starts. Doesn\u2019t respond to touch of fingers almost every time but responds to touch of thumb. Compared to this, Samsung touch is butter smooth & without any hiccup. 2. I have tried possibly everything to shut off touch pad noise\u2026disabling it from sound settings, updating phone..application permissions but nothing at all has worked\u2026seems like a fault in my piece & hence I am planning to return this phone. 3. You need to install an app to permanently stay on a 3G network which is not the case with Samsung where u just need to select WCDMA mode, in this phone there is an option to set your preference to be on 3G mode but it doesn\u2019t work. 4. There is no widget for torch flashlight\u2026u need to install an app for it. 5. Can\u2019t add speed dials\u2026.need to install an app for it. 6. No file manager\u2026.again need to install an app for it. 7. Notification panel is really crappy\u2026for person like me who switches on/off data network, it\u2019s a huuuuuuge PIA to go through settings and all just to turn on/off data\u2026seriously developers what were you smoking??? ;) \uf04a \u2026. again need to install an app for it. 8. Can\u2019t add any song directly as your ringtone\u2026.. Overall I feel, if you really wanna go for a 10k+ phone, there are many many more options available in the market..explore everything before zeroing on this one.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone from Flipkart within first 10 minutes of it's sale. I was happy about my purchase with whatever limitations the phone has. But my happiness was short lived, as the screen had a crack after a drop from hardly 2 feet height under gravity. Before this I was using an iphone, Samsung Omnia, Nokia Lumia and each phone was dropped from considerable heights but nothing happened. This proves that the MOTO G 2nd Gen is outstandingly and extremely fragile. More than the fragility of the phone I got pissed off with the phone because of the after sales service offered by MOTOROLA at Kanpur. The authorized service center person has told that it would cost me some where about 7000/- and he offered a magnanimous discount of 300/-. The new phone costs 12999/- where as the screen costs you 7000/-. Either the Motorola is fooling the customer or the authorized service center is fooling. Just because of the service center the phone will get a single star rating. Come on Motorola, please control your authorized service centers, they are bringing bad reputation to your brand. If it continues this way very soon your brand will undo all the good work of recent times.",

But it compensates this by its high speed interface and memory . Overall its a good buy and value for money is guaranteed. in my previous orders flipkart's delivery sucked but this time it was really fast, i got the phone in just 4 days that was awesome.",

Pros: Good Speed for browsing, Multi Tasking is excellent, Main Camera is good, Front camera is not bad, it has good speakers. I haven't played any games with the device so i can't comment on that subject. Life and durability is yet to be determined. Cons: Battery is charging slowly and it drains quickly. I am not surprised by this, as this is the case with most of the smart phones. Data Cable is not available with the mobile, even though plenty of micro usb cables are available in the market, Moto should have provided the data cable. After Installing Battery saving apps (Battery Doctor) now the Battery life is good. Overall its a good phone at this price. If you want a good smart phone under 15k this is the one.",

This lasy delivery partner took 33 hours to deliver it withing the city. My address may be just 2-3 km from the office of DELHIVERY in my city.

It has amazing looks and perfect hardware for an android app developer like me. The cameras are excellent. However the airtel offer didnt really work for me as yet. The earphones do not match the quality of the phone and the 5.0 update isnt exactly up and running but it should come soon. The screen is nice and Motorola outdid themselves. The phone is a powerhouse rather than a black candy bar. Mind you, you don't get a USB cable with this piece. I love my phone. I call it the 'Black Pearl'!!",

Thought that google contacts will automatically sync after signing in and using Migrate but did not happen. Had to transfer the vcf file from my Samsung to get all my contacts. SIM card contacts of course did sync. 2. Cannot force the phone to use 3G. I use a DOCOMO connection and it changes from E to H and H+ randomly. Could be a problem of Docomo. 3. Started the day with full battery at 6:30 AM and by 8:15 , of constant listening to music and using 2G + 3G the battery reached 76%. So I am not sure if the battery will last the day. Charged the phone for 8 hours by the way. 4. Using Samsung earphones , the audio seems good. The provided headphones don't look or feel good. 5. Migrate transferred most of my apps , settings etc. A really good feature to have. Only if it had transferred my contacts too, I would have been giving this a 5 rating. 6. Feels good in the hands , easy for reading",

And I don't regret it one bit. Below are the pros and cons i observed in these 20 days of usage. PROS: 1. Both front and back camera are just fine. Pics come out pretty decent. Obviously u can't expect DSLR quality in this price range. 2. 1 GB RAM is more than enough to run all the apps and games smoothly on this device and the quad core processor is pretty good with no lags so far. 3. Front speakers are great. Sound cracks a little at high volume but that''s not a major issue at all. 4. Smooth touch and awesome looks. CONS: So far, the only issue i have faced is the battery back up. Its not really good, but then you can always carry a power bank along with you. In the end, I would just say, it's a good product from MOTO and definitely a great value for money.",

I think moto can over come these issues through the updates.",

L. which is the best part of this. 3- awesome camera capture with rear as well as by front cam. 4- gud battery life.. gives me 1 day of backup.. which is good for my personal use. cons- got faulty product as i said 1- plastic back panel.. but it was mentioned that the panel is made of polycorbonic matt finish .. which gives u rubburised feel. 3- it was lagging even in small graphics games. like subway surf.. where my frnds same product not lags at all in any game.. weather it is of higher graphic or smaller graphic games conclusion- the cons which i have mentioned was of the faulty product. well i made a return request for my product and flipkart has accepted my request and promised me to deliver the new product at 20th of dec. so i will wrote my original review on original product... but i must say, flipkart return policy is best thats why i always came to flipkart for shopping.. two stars for the faulty product... but i will increase stars when i get satisfied with my replaced product... till date enjoy with two stars...",

Which is quite surprise for me after buying :-), I tested with my micromax tab keyboard, kingston and sandisk pendrive - data trasfer is greate and supports major items. - Its also come with latest android. Go for moro g second gen if you have this budget, don't go behind any other brand like samsung, lg or panasonic. I also have Nokia 620, it also good on same price if you like windows. Many user doen't like this but if you want stable product and better battery, go for windows. My bettery live upto 2 days with wifi and more than a day in 3G with skype calling and watsapp messaging :-)",

Delivery man came to my office, he called me 5 times as i was not there, i was unable to attend, he left me a message. When i called him back, he came again to my office to deliver it. Usually courier people call us on phone and ask us to collect shipment from their office. About Phone: My budget was 20k . Searched on internet for months and finally decided about Moto g2. Phone looks stunning. It is easy to handle as it is curve shaped. Display and Camera are good for the budget. Stereo speakers are awesome. Battery was the biggest issue for which i didnt buy it earlier.. But after using 3 days, i m satisfied with it. Battary lasted upto 11pm since mornig for last 2 days for moderate using. And USB OTG function is working fine, we could transfer data @ 15mbps from a usb pendrive. Who should go for it? If your budget is near 15 (20 if u want OTG on phone), u want a 5 inch phone that is easy to handle and looks good, go for it. But if u want to use net throughout day, go for any other phone, or buy one power bank also with moto g.",

Day 3 started my struggle with the phone getting constantly getting hung up and getting over heated. called the customer service exe who told me that its normal for the phone to get heated up and that i should not complain about it. i was very much upset about the product and now the customer service was even more hurtful. eventually i requested for a replacement reaching the limit of my patience and i get a call back saying that hanging is a natural thing and that i should restore my phone to factory setting and that it would solve my problem. and that said we will call u back to check if the trouble shoot has worked or not which they never did. and went ahead and closed my request saying that we cant take a return request as we solved your problem. how does this even sound logical? than a few days later i call up again to place a replacement request this time they say that they are replacing the phone as they accept its faulty. and said that the phone will reach me on 8th. i was keeping a track of it on their website and i was waiting for my phone the last i checked it said that the product was dispatched from bangalore. and is expected in Hyderabad. and the very next day it said return request is canceled. i was shocked and called up the customer care and they said it was canceled due to logistical problems. and they said they were placing a request immediately and that the product will be delivered today. i called in specifically to ask if it can be deliver on today as i was out of station but i got a call yesterday saying i need to come collect the product some 4-5 kms away from my delivery point. i told him that i am not in the city and asked him to come today for which he responded very rudely I quote\" Main thumara Naukar nahu huun agar chaheyae to aa ke lena nahito return kardunga\" i was shocked and requested him to deliver it today. he finally agreed after repeated calling and said he will be delivering it by 11 am today. i haven't got call till now so i called up the customer care and expressed my disappointed she just disconnected my call and i was put through to the survey. I can understand that u guys don't have the intent to help but this is retarded. lost hope on e-commerce. thanks to one company. Motorolla you have done a big mistake by selecting flipkart as your only retailer. don't know about you but i am a customer am completely disappointed.",

Software - Moto G2 is known for running near stock android and is going to get the latest android version Lollipop soon and the next year's android version or Android M release falls in the phone's 18 month upgrade window too, which means this phone will run the latest softwares upto 2016 or till Android N releases. All in all we are up for a great software experience. Hardware/Specs - I personally have a list of minimum specs that I need on my phone and Moto G 2014 fits most of them. Min 8 MP Rear Cam \u2713 Min 720p Screen \u2713 Min 1 GB Ram \u2713 Min 16 GB Internal Storage \u2713 SD Card Slot \u2713 4.5 - 5 Inch Screen \u2713 Removable Battery \u2717 Buying Moto G 2014 was an amazing deal for me. I'm pretty sure I am going to have this phone till 2016 when Android N releases and hopefully there will be a Moto G 2016 with far better specs (Read 1080p screen, more RAM,better Cam,etc) to which I'll upgrade. Until then I'll have fun with my Moto G 2014. 5/5 for this one. EDIT- One thing I noticed is how fast the battery charges. It might be fast just for me though since my previous phone was a 2010 Samsung Galaxy Ace and Moto G 2014 is this year's model and technology has surely improved tremendously in 4 years. So me feeling it charges fast might mean nothing to someone who uses latest phones.",

No doubt the phone has got everything with this price tag. But, I found two major cons on this phone. The first one is sometimes the latch up of network is poor for which i am disapponted. The second thing is that it has poor battery life for which I have to charge the battery twice a day.Even if I don't play games, still the battery lasts only upto 4-6hrs. Also, it takes lots of time to charge the battery(around 4hrs). Otherwise,the phone is good. worth buying it.",

I have used this phone for more than a week now and here's what I found: Pros: - Screen clarity and resolution - Camera quality (both front and rear) - Unadulterated android experience - It is fast and is great for multi-tasking - Good shopping experience with Flipkart Cons: - Average battery life. It lasts little less than a day with moderate use - The headset quality looks cheap and fragile.",

After receiving the hand set when I tried with my Micro sim, handset is not recognising the sim. I tried with 10 micro sims in both the slots but it is not recognising the sim. When I called to customer care on the same day they said support team will reach me in 24 hrs but support people reach me on sunday. They given some trouble shooting steps. but it not worked out. I am totally disappointed with the support team and technical team. I am running behind the people for atleast exchange of the handset but they are not properly responding. Really very pathetic for me from the last 4 days. No option to give zero rating I request all the people make sure that you should not receive a defect piece.",

It provides Moto Assist which is pre-loaded in the phone. Some people wrote about heating issues but I did not find any issues regarding that. The only con I found is that it requires too much time for charging and average battery life. Flipkart Service is superb. Took only 2 days to deliver it. 4stars for the phone and 1star for fast delivery by Flipkart. Those who are planning to buy it, please go for it! :)",

The screen cover broke rather easily. The drop was rather small (from table to ground). The lcd screen is intact but the glass on top of it broke quite easily and the repair costs about 7k. I'd suggest buyers opt in for a screen guard and a good casing to protect the phone from these kind of unexpected disasters. Battery life is ok, it lasts about 8 hours with internet etc working and lollipop upgrade should improve upon that. For the remaining part, the phone is excellent for its price. Hardly any noticeable bugs, and the touch is very smooth. This phone has given me the best experience so far, minus the crack that happened to come up rather easily. A sturdier build from motorola would have taken this a lot far certainly.",

I am writing the review about moto g 2nd gen after using the phone about 1 month. Pros: 1. 8 mp primary and 2 mp secondary camera. Both the camera is capturing nice picture. Also, primary camera works good at night also because of flash light. 2. Front speakers are stereo which will make you feel good while playing games or listening song. Audio quality is very good even at full volume. 3. I can play heavy games like asphalt 8, call of duty, etc without any lagging. 4. Phone connectivity(Network, wifi, bluetooth) is also good. I never saw my network fluctuation as other user was mentioning that this phone has some network connectivity problem. 5. Battery runs for more than or approx 24 hours if you use normally. I always use my phone in this way: About 3 hours for listening song without headphone, playing game asphalt 8, contract killer for 1 and half hour, 2 hours of calling on 3g network, 1 hour whats app, 2 hours internet browsing (chrome). My phone is 24 hours connected to wifi. Using both sim, one is 3g and one is 2g. Facebook, whats app, gmail app, linked in services run for 24 hours in background. Using my phone in this way runs for 24 hours which is pretty good for smartphone. 6. Gorilla glass is tough.So many time, I carried key with my smartphone (by mistake) but didn't got any scratch. 7. The design of phone is very good. Its good in hand and it will not slip from your hand because of the bacpanel design. Cons: 1. Basically, i don't have any point. So, i can write only one thing that camera app can be improved more.",

I got the mobile with defect in sim card slot and got replacement.The next one which i got had big defect which i never expect from moto brand....i.e MOTHERBOARD itself dead.Finally i contacted service center in chennai. They have blasted a sensational news that they have 10 mobiles in queue for mother board change.They said that it will take 2 days for repair. Let's assume how bad it is within 2 days 10 mobiles need mother board replacement.If hardware is not good then whats the point in using the latest Android software.I have used this mobile only 2 months. Even though there is warranty how can customers rotate around service centers upto 1 year. I'll never buy mobile from motorola brand. May be google sold motorola to lenovo because of bad hardare production.",

Only worrying about the 1.52 SAR value that means high radiation and sometimes call quality is not good enough , Getting hot if you use camera or call for more than 15 mints. Overall great product !!",

            "comment": "MOTO G, Plagued with connectivity issues I bought this phone after my HTC One S was infected with the Helicoptering Bug. This phone was equal in spec to my previous phone and I could not find anything better in the 10-14k other than this MOTO G 2nd gen. After a use of few days, I found out that the performance of this phone is below expectations.\u2019 Asphalt 8 does not run in medium graphics, it has be in low or the game crashes. Other high graphics games fare the same way. Only low graphics games like puzzles and temple run, run properly. The HTC one S played the games in mid and high settings without any issues, both the phones are equipped with 1 GB ram. Secondly there are some connectivity issues with the Wi-Fi in this phone. The hotspot signal drops repeatedly, causing other devices to disconnect. I got this phone replaced 2 twice for this issue but still the issue remains with the 3rd set. So asked for a refund for the same. I was told that the problem was due to Market cut micro sim card. So checked my phone with 5-6 different sims with no solution of the problem. There are some issues with the touch also... a lot of times I could not type the letters on the side of the screen.... Overall the phone is good for moderate gaming, display also good, battery life is decent but if you use wifi tethering then you are going to face connectivity issues. i decided to go for a redmi 1s for now will upgrade later. ( the old sims creating problems with MOTO G 2nd are working fine with the 1S) But Kudos to Flipkart for its service , really top notch. I cannot expect this kind of service from local shops also. i got 2 replacement sets and finally a refund. 5 Star rating to flipkart.",

Available RAM also not good. after installed few apps it is showing 180 MB available. performance is not good that time. coming to camera, 8 MP, but performance is not that much good, it looks more than 5MP only not before 8 MP. i think flip kart only is giving hip to this mobile only but really it is not a good mobile.

Dont expect a flagship killer in this price but sure it is the best mobile in the market considering its price and frequent updates.The build quality is also good but the design is too old and you may not like it. Quality of charger is super, no USB cable in the box and headphone is too cheap. Buy it if you want a non sluggish and non pre-installed application phone with pure google experience. Nothing more.",

Hardware is best, looks are slim and stunning, latest andriod updates guaranteed, no extra bloatwares, in built softwares are very useful and of fine qualities, battery backup is great, camera is way too stunning, front stereo speakers are the best in class and performance, never hangs, best optimization of memory and processor, screen and touch are mind blowing, you have the option of different colors replaceable back-covers (original moto brand) that suits ur style. The only con I found is the charger is of low power but u can have high power charger frm market and get rapid charging. So the bottom line .. its the best phone among the ones i used within 15k price bracket. I'm loving it.. js go fr it without thinking twice!",

On facing multiple issues with my previous Lumia phone under 1 year and being denied warranty, really bad service from one of the well known retail outlet of Thane. I felt taking the risk of buying online was worth a try. Research and Booking : Windows phone was a sure \"NO\" with my past Microsoft & dealer experience. I had vast choice when i stepped into deciding on which Andriod phone. Decided on a budget of 15 K and started searching. ASUS Zenphone 5 was cheaper and an option i was willing to try. Due to the larger size and lower sound quality zeroed into booking Moto G 2nd Gen. Delivery and Packaging: Must admit Flipkart delivery much before ETA (5 days), delivered in 2 days. The Packaging was good and it was a fresh piece. Phone Usage Review : Initial few days faced a bit of trouble due to switching from Windows to Android. In 2 days was able to adjust and the Android experience is very good, though graphically you may miss the windows interface. Very Good sound and call quality. Camera is decent. The phone build feels strong and solid, buttons are sturdy the rubber back also gives better grip. Battery life is also very good with approx of 4 hrs of con calls + whats app + 10 - 15 mins gaming + reading some stuff online the battery still had 40 % remaining. Would recommend this phone to any user looking for Android phone under 15 K.",

Flipkart notified that i will be receiving a call from their executive with in 2 days and then further process will be initiated. Its been 5 days since then and there is no contact being made by Flipkart. I called the Flipkart customer care multiple times. They have been asking me to wait for he call; \"If not today, you will receive it tomorrow. We are prioritizing the issue. This is the best we can do\". It is very frustrating to keep waiting for a call to get the product replaced. Flipkart has a market image of customer friendly approach but such actions will tarnish your image.",

I've been using this phone since 12th September. after 2 and half months of usage,I can tell you everything about this phone First of all,I would like to thank WS retail for this product. Now I wont talk here about specs(because you can read it in the product description).I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE. Best things: 1.HD screen is classic.Delivers sharp image and texts 2.Stereo speakers are very nice. 3.Due to round edge,it is very easy to handle 4.Rear Camera is also nice.Some details get missed in photos ,but overall it's a nice camera. 5.Battery life is good(except while playing heavy games) 6.The Phone looks really smart :) 7.SD card support is appreciable. Average things: 1.Front Camera is bad.(looks live 1.3 Mega pixels) Worst things:1.Due to 1 GB of RAM,,the phone lags often while multi-tasking(1.2 GHz quad core is nice,but RAM should have been at-least 1.5 GB).I am a phone-lover( I have used Galaxy S4,my father's iPhone 5c, Nexus 5)and therefore, I can surely say that IT WILL BE A MAJOR ISSUE.,because RAM matters the most while multi-tasking. Verdict:Overall it is a good phone,but at the same price,asus zenfone 5 (16 GB) is available,which has 2 GB RAM(and all the things exactly the same) will be a better buy.Don't think that I am saying this only looking at the specs.My room-mate has Zenphone 5,which has nearly EVERYTHING better than this(except Battery life). So,if you want to buy this phone and will upgrade it next year,then there's no problem.But if you are planning to buy a phone that will last for atleast 2 years,then Believe me,go for Zenphone 5.",

Not satisfied with the product screen heats up I have replaced the products for 2 times but still the problems like heating and low speaker quality The phone hangs up for a while when getting back to home screen phone also gets slow with closing and opening the apps the phone has a pure version of android but still, it lags!!! Camera Quality is Awesome, slo-mo is superb but performance in speed and utilization of the OS is not that good motorolla should improve a lot... coming to the speakers of the phone, when i keep it on the full volume it gets shattering... when its new it works fine but after 2 days it ll begin... very disapointed with the phone. so ** but Flipkart you're awesome!!! Delivery in time, replacement with that grantee... so for you * * * * * Motorola please improve the quality and one more thing, the back cover get lose after removing for about 4-5 times.... it might sound stupid to mention but for a college guy like me, it is annoying that my phone's cover has a gap or not perfect fit!!!",

That is when the battery drops to below 20% the top portion of the phone gets heat up and I can feel my ear gets heat up while talking at such a low battery power. Also I have read reviews of many people complaining about the charger that heats up while charging. Mine is fine and works well.",

Pros : 1. good camera. 2. stylish design. it feels good when i hold it in my hand. 3. the front stereo speakers are an asset to this phone 4. there is no lag when i play games. I did not try high end games. But Asphalt 8 airborne stopped working after playing first level. Things that can be improved: 1. The battery is not so great. It lasts for 1 day with very minimal usage. 2. I have trouble with the dual sim settings. Sometimes the signal for secondary sim goes down. It can only be restored by restarting the phone. 3. Some of the high end games like Asphalt 8 Airborne wont run. They will crash after sometime. If not for the dual sim problem, I would have rated this 5 stars.",

Got android updated as soon as i connected to wifi. It accepts micro sims only so I had to cut my 2 sim cards before starting using them. Camera and sound is not so good. I get 6 MP instead of 8 MP while using picture ratio of 16:9. Display screen is sharp but in sunlight it is not very bright. That maybe because I use auto brightness. Battery life is average. Once fully charged, it lasts at least for a day while using internet and games. It takes at least 3 hours to get fully charged from fully discharged state. But overall battery life is better than most other mobiles I have seen. The mobile speed got little slower when I installed many apps, but it got smoother again after removing unnecessary apps.",

Now, about the phone this phone is really superb as much as I know I researched a lot about it coz i want value for my money. I will be writing a full review after using it (delivery date is 10th feb) I was looking for the phone that will suit my needed specifications. for more than 2 months I was looking and wasn't satisfied with any of the phone in the market. good phones are too costly and I was unable to decide which phone to choose",

Experience illustrated below to the prospective buyers of Moto G2. - The first ph had burning smell from the charging socket area of the ph. Submitted complaint & replacement ph was shipped in a week. - The second ph charger got kaput after 3 weeks, when i requested for a replacement charger FK said they will not be able to provide original Moto charger. They gave me an option to buy a compatible charger, but why should i compromise - what if the ph performance gets effected? FK made me wait & tested my patience for long. They took close to 3 weeks to call and speak \u2013 and the rep who called, was very rude & said he will process the refund \u2013 keep the phone & all other accessories intact for pickup without being polite and having patience to listen to me. Now I had to be firm \u2013 said you are not the decision maker \u2013 I have paid for it & so will it reside on me to decide what I want! Informed him to make arrangement for replacement ph. Ph, was delivered in 4days from the date of request. PS: This ph, also had burning smell from the ph charging socket. As one of my friend ph also had the same kind of experience \u2013 we kept quite & started living with it. - The Third ph. This one was working fine thankfully no issues, but after 2 weeks the ph started showing its infrequent tantrums. When i receive a call from the contacts in my ph. i don't get their name on the display when i get a call, sometime display screen use to be white in color - when i get incoming call. Got the ph. reset to factory mode, but didn't help. Submitted a request for return - FK advised to reset the ph, to factory mode. Again it didn't help, they agreed to replace. I was shocked when they agreed for a replacement so easy? Why no dram like the last time to delay in agreeing to provide a replacement ph.? Felt something fishy, but i was happy & ignored - assuming it was may be one of the odd customer service rep experience the last time. -The fourth ph, It was delivered in two days. The day when it arrived \u2013 my brother for whom I had bought this ph \u2013 was very upset with the first FK product that he had bought & the awful experience. He use to always be against buying products from online\u2026 He kept fussing with me, I told you\u2026\u2026..? He spoke to the delivery guy & tried to make communication with him while he was verifying the return product & the box. Brother \u2013 \u201cHas FK been receiving quite a lot complaints for MOTO G2 ph? & until now I have returned 3 ph., what do you guys do with the returned ph.,?\u201d Delivery Guy \u201cYes sir \u2013 there are quite a lot complaints about this ph model. Sir - When the customer returns the defective product, FK seller will fix those problems and resell them to customers again \u2013 if they don\u2019t resell then they will be in loss sir. They have to close the shop & sit at home\u201d My brother was shocked to hear that from the FK delivery person. What about the notice FK puts at the bottom of the page of every product? Please Note: All products sold on Flipkart are brand new and 100% genuine 1.With all fear & fingers crossed \u2013 my brother opened the pack, switched on the ph. 2. He experienced white light lines on the either sides of the screen 3. Display quality & color was dull 4. Took a picture from camera lot of grains on the picture even without zooming. 5. You will notice rainbow colors on the display for few seconds when you get an incoming call. 6. Drop in calls when you are out on the street, inspite of having full network. 7. Hearing speaker would fumble. The above experience & reasons in the last three months were enough to decide for taking a refund instead of a replacement ph. A very sick experience & FK using such blackjack tactics to make business. SHAME ON YOU FK & WS RETAIL",

Pathetic Battery: Drains after 7 hrs usage if wi-fi is ON 2. Cannot handle even a single drop on floor: sure shot scratches here & there or tearing of some part from the corners because handset body is not at all strong. 3. No call recording facility 4. Lengthy & sucking process of saving new contact. 5. Uncomfortable headphones 6. Touch response: On the scale of 5...i'l give 2 7. While playing subway surfer...It hangs many time If above problems doesn't bother you.....hurray you qualified to buy this beauty :p",

Got the replacement as usual with in 2 days,but this time i figured that the colour brightness was not up to the expected, i can feel the difference in color since the mobile i used first time is crystal clear in terms of color,but the replaced one is worst, Immediately after the product got delivered with in 30 minutes i went for another replacement. Flipkart as usual good response and good service but the 3rd piece i got was also having the same problem of color deficient. I checked with my colleague mobiles of same model, i can see my mobile color brightness is dull......It is like same as 2nd piece .....now i got compromised with the product...because of bored trying for one more replacement and no guarantee that i will get the best product......I'm tiered of exchanging one more time even though i had a chance for replacement........! I am not against flipkart because i love their services and customer repsonse as well as they give 100% for their customers.......but i just want to share my reviews on the product so that people of my kind will think before they buy this product.....I even don't blame WS retail as well...because i got many products from the same seller...they did a fantastic job in replacing every time i ask for.......whom to blame then.....is it MOTOROLA company who manufactured these kind of products...! But a big loss for me is that i brought this product for an exchange of my samsung mobile (for 2k-----many people in my office told you sold it for very cheap price, they are ready to pay 3 to 4 k for my old mobile) this makes me really embarrassed...... !",

Got bad experience and response from them. They are asking 7K for a display though my touch is working. I could say for that amount we can buy a new phone.please think and buy phones.",

My phone started to get an issue with the receiver / head piece just after 4th week . And have been asked to visit the service centre for the 2nd time within 2 months . And don't be surprised if the service centre in your locality is overcrowded and ask you to submit the phone for 2 weeks and not even to call to enquire before 12 days , and then fails to fix your issue. If you are looking a secondary phone or a phone to gift to some one who doesn't have much dependency on it and has plenty of time to worry about it , This is the one for you.",

Flipkart is so far just extending the date for solving the issue rather than actually solving it on ground. This is not fair extending the TAT thrice intending to complete the 30 days so that the customer can't \"Request Return\" again, is it? I have been a valued customer for Flipkart so far.

It happened 2 times with me so i returned the phone and received the refund. Then i booked MOTO G. The touch is simply amazing, Built is also good.. It is not too heavy light then Nitro. i use cell phone for Whatsapp, FB, Call n sometimes SMS. I don't play games.. So i can use the phone for more than 24 hours in a single go without charging. My recommendations would be go for it.. :)",

It started showing some touch related problems within 35 days from purchase and its touch stopped working completely on 25 Oct, 2014 without any external damage. I submitted my phone to Motorola Authorized Service Center in Dehradun, after keeping my phone for 3 weeks they told me that touch of my phone was working fine and it had some motherboard issue. After confronting them why it too so long to discover the problem they started making lame excuses and started blaming one another. Also, Service Center was located in very dingy and dark place and employees handling the customers were very unprofessional. As i had lost trust in the Engineers who were handling the phone I contacted the senior officials to provide some proper solution to my problem. They assured me to ship a new phone, but it has been week and a half and haven't heard from them regarding how and when it will be shipped. So please before buying this phone kindly remember their service center support is really bad (specially in Dehradun). PS: I have to give 1 star rating in order to submit my review, but from my side its negative.",

Better get your own. 9) Bigger phone than nexus 5. Both HxWxB 10) Flipkart delivery was excellent 3 day before delivery date. Nice job team.",

The reason is I was not able to decide between Moto G 2 and Asus Zenfone 5(16gb). Both phones are priced at exactly same amount that is 12999. Talking about the facts, zenfone 5 packed with 1.6 GHz intel's dual core processor which actually can perform like 4 virtual cores when needed plus its 2 gb RAM, this combo performs better as compared to Moto G 2nd gen. But that doesn't mean Moto G 2 is way behind the performance of zenfone. Reason is Moto runs stock android which saves lot of memory providing you the best android experience. Moto can run almost all games zonfone can. Here are they key points which made me choose moto g 2nd gen over zenfone and I am 100% happy with my choice! 1. Battery backup way better than zenfone. Have been using it since some days and it lasts all day long thats what I needed. compered to zenfone it gives backup of hardly 6-7 hrs 2. Stock android means the best android experience 3. Once of the first phone to receive android L update 4. Splash resistant screen 5. It is all round in true sense!",

Display is nice with decent viewing angle but could had been perfect with a full HD display. It's also a good performance wise because its a stock android device. It plays high graphic games like Asphalt 8 , Modern Combat 5 & Dead Trigger 2 smoothly courtesy its 1.2 GHz Qulacomm processor supported by 1 GB of RAM . It comes with 16 GB inbuilt for storage. This time u can expand the storage with external memory card up to 32 GB. It has a 8 MP rear camera which does a decent job & doesn't disappoint in low light with led flash light, front facing camera is of 2MP which will be sufficient for selfie lovers. Best about Moto devices is that it receive Android updates easily before other smartphones. Recommended for all those looking for a looking for a smartphone under 15k & who want a pure android performance",

I personally own the Moto G, Moto E and now the Moto G2 I own this pc of great update since almost 4 months now and I have already got it replaced 2 times with the third request already under process. There is genuinely no concern with this model, in fact it is an answer to lot of concerns faced by competing brand phones. The only reason I have had to keep getting replacement for it is the display screen. On all three occasions, the display screen has had the same issue. And the issue is: the display screen, on the volume rocker side, is a bit raised above the main phone body due to which there is a thin gap which emits the illumination form the display from the side of the phone. This seems to be the concern with all the three pcs that I have had my hands on, making it look more like product batch issue. Having all this said, Flipkart guys have been super understanding and of great technical assistance over this issue every-time. Really kudos to you guys. Not easy keeping up the standard to the \"T\", consistently. Final verdict: Go for this product even if you have a super humongous budget and can go fancy buying an expensive phone. Because you cannot beat the futuristic approach, that Motorola had before it sold itself to Google, with any other brand. Just a word of caution, as soon as you receive this product check for the screen. If any concern, contact Flipkart immediately. I am sure they would be more than glad to assist you on the same. Those 3 stars, they belong to you guys @ flipkart!!",

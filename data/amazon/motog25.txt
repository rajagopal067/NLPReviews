            "comment": "Definitely a GREAT phone for the price, even if it could be more expensive, it would worth it. It have a great front facing camera (2mp), nice sizing, smooth software (looking forward to Lollipop!!) an amazing screen resolution, vivid colors and a clear software without all those trash of apps pre loaded. Will update whe in use it for a few days!Update: works good on lollipop, just ran a little faster off battery, and some features are removed like face unblocking. But also includes a great data counter and a useful torch, it could maybe run a little faster, and it have some bugs, but with the update of lollipop, i think most of them would be solved.I can watch movies, and series easily, the sound is GREAT, i love the fact that the speakers are in the front, so you can hear everything, the resolution of the screen is great (please don't compare it to a retina display, is not obvious the same)The size is perfect for media, the camera is really good.I have installed at least 72 apps, and when it gets laggy, i adjust the animations on developer mode and all solved.I love this phone, offers a lot for a good price.You should get a good case, and forget a little in the aestethics, because of the cuts in the material investments that Motorola does on this phones, you can really regret if you just use it with no case. (i use it with a TPU case and goes good with it, no screen protector yet, and so far, Gorilla Glass 3 is doing its job amazingly... No scratch before 1 month of use without flip case :)",

Plays Netflix and Pandora very well.Update 1:This is a broader issue with many phones: The screen is polarized so in landscape mode the screen is black if you are wearing polarized sun glasses.In the car I have Bluetooth, Screen on max brightness, and GPS running I use a good amount of the battery up quickly. Car Charger is definitely useful.Awesome phone. I like it way better then the Nexus 4. Seems like a lot more stuff just works. On the Nexus 4 I had poor sound quality and Bluetooth never worked well especially in my Honda Civic. The Moto G works very well with my Honda.Update 2:Over Blue tooth and with ear buds plugged in, I do not have have the volume up very high.",

The battery lasts  quietly a couple of days. Although the memory is only 8 GB you are  able to save the majority of apps, music and photos on the SD card that allows you to have about 3-4 gb of free space. The breakthrough was undoubtedly the camera that has grown from 5 to 8 mpx. It seems nothing here but these 3 px more really makes the difference. The pictures in bright light are fantastic and those with less light has much less noise that the one from Moto G 2013. I have not found problems in portability being Moto G 2014 slightly thinner, and the weight and absolutely the same as the first Moto G. Bought on Amazon Spain for 161 euro, 168 including shipping, a really good deal. A fantastic mobile that I really recommend to everyone.",

            "comment": "Check out my Youtube channel AppsOnFire for a video review!So my phone has recently broke and I didn't have that much too spend so I was looking for a phone that can still perform well and not break the budget and I decided to pick up the Moto G because I have heard really great things about it. It is a great mid range phone at the price of a low end one. It has some pretty good specs and you are also getting Android Lollipop all for the price of $180 Unlocked. So here is my full review of the Moto G 2nd GenerationDesignSo the design of the phone is actually not that bad. It certainly doesn't look like your paying only 180 dollars, it actually has pretty nice build quality and feels really nice in that hand. It may be hard to notice but the phone has a very subtle curve do it which makes it more comfortable to hold. Its not the thinnest phone out there but looks fairly slim and sleek. It also is not that heavy, it is pretty much entirely made of plastic and the back is removable which gives you access  to the sim card slot and micro sd slot for expandable storage which is a big plus. You get a 5 inch 720p display and you also get some front facing speakers which is not too bad. You got all your buttons on the side which I found to be pretty mushy when first pressing them but got them used to them not too long after. Overall the design of the Moto G is nothing to write home about but is amazing for the price and I am pretty satisfied with how the phone looks and feels.CameraSo usually on smartphones this cheap you get a camera that is pretty bad but that is definitely not the case with the Moto G. You actually get a pretty decent camera. But don't expect this to be a flagship camera. The phone focuses a little bit slow and it doesnt take photos very fast either. The Camera on the moto g also suffers in lowlight situations but if you have the right lighting this camera is actually pretty good. The is the same for the front camera as well. It actually takes some pretty good selfies in good conditions. Here are some samples.PerformanceSo how does this phone perform at such a low price. Many people think at this price point that a phone can't perform well but that is not the case here with the Moto G. It is still packing a 1.2 ghz Quad core processor with a gig of Ram which is still some decent specs in todays standards. Everything usually runs smoothly with the Moto G because it is running pretty much stock android with no bloatware or skin to slow it down. But multitasking seems to slow this phone down and will start to lag if you have a bunch of apps open. But the lag is not so bad that the phone becomes unusable. Overall this phone can handle your daily tasks as long as you dont go crazy and the battery life will last almost a full day of you are not a crazy power user.Final thoughtsSo that is pretty much the end of my review and the Moto G is a great budget phone for people who need a backup or who are just trying to save some money but still want a great phone.",

            "comment": "I recently made the switch from iOS to Android, mostly because I am definitely on a budget and my old 4th Gen iPhone just wasn't cutting it for me anymore. Without a budget-conscious option from Apple, I turned to the world of Android and immediately got a ton of recommendations for the Moto G. Having hands-on experience with some other lower-end Android phones like the LG Optimus, I was initially nervous I was signing on for a slowed-down experience and a phone bloated with tons of proprietary software, but what I got instead was a speedy, fun-to-use, and quite simply slightly mindblowing experience for someone who's never had a smartphone that wasn't at least a year old by the time it got into my hands.The phone is pretty much the perfect size, fitting in every pocket comfortably but still feeling large and impressive when playing videos. As someone going from a 480p 3.5-inch display to a 720p 5-inch display this felt like coming out of the dark ages. One of the common things I saw when looking at whether to grab a 1st gen or 2nd gen Moto G was the drop in ppi, but I honestly feel like the images are as crisp as you'd want them to be and quite honestly with the resolution of the phone the top bar and clock feel a little on the small side for me, so a smaller display with the same resolution would actually be rather annoying.Technologically this phone was a massive upgrade for me. Apps loaded in a snap and once I opened an app there was almost no lag between making a selection and getting a result. The software included with the phone was minimal, which is fantastic as someone who hates bloatware and wants to have as much control over their experience as possible. Motorola had only a few proprietary apps installed by default, all of which were opt-in. So far I haven't opted in to Motorola Assist or Alert, and the only other Moto app that came installed was Migrate, which I used to move my contacts and calendars from my iPhone to my Moto G without manually copying the numbers. Since that's the only thing it can really be used for when switching from iOS to Android, I can't give a full review of some of its other features, but it worked well for what I used it for. The rest of the pre-installed apps were all default Android and Google apps, which I won't review in much detail since most people's mileage will definitely vary on those.I feel less-than-qualified to give a detailed breakdown on things like the camera quality and processor speed, but as someone who knows what RAM is I can say that this phone makes a compromise in that area. 1 GB is a comfortable amount for any one thing you'd want to do, and the phone is pretty intelligent about shutting down apps if the current app is more memory-hungry than others. On the other hand, if you're a power user who would be looking to take advantage of multitasking, or if you want to play some of the more intense mobile games, you'd want to look at spending more money. With the expandable SD storage for things like music, movies, pictures, or other files, 8 GB feels like a comfortable amount of on-board storage. This would be the main reason to choose a Moto G over a Moto E, since the OS uses almost 2.5 GBs all by itself leaving little room for apps that either can't or shouldn't be stored on an SD card. I have a 32 GB micro SD card in my phone and I still use 5 GBs of my onboard storage just on apps and downloaded Spotify playlists.One other limitation of this phone that I personally do not care about is the lack of 4G data. There is no 4G radio in the phone, so the highest speed you'll be able to get on this phone is 3G. Personally I don't even have a data plan, since I live on a college campus where wi-fi is both reliable and ubiquitous. For some people, though, this would be a deal-breaker. There is a 4G version of the 1st generation Moto G, and if this is the one reason you don't want this phone I'd highly encourage checking that out.For the price, I'm almost certain this is the best phone you're going to find new out of the box. Really, unless you're a power user and you don't want to be conscious of how much memory your apps use while idling in the background, this is definitely a phone worth considering for any budget if you're looking to save money. The one concern I do have is longevity, since as flagship phones bolster their processors and RAM developers might look to use more of that power, leaving users of underpowered phones using outdated apps. This is what happened to me with my 4th Generation iPhone. As it stands, though, this is the best buy in the smartphone world right now and a must-buy for anyone on a small budget not looking to lease or finance.",

            "comment": "Wow, incredible device in the midrange pricing range.This turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. I spend a lot of time in Europe, and I used to plug my US T-Mobile SIM card in my iPhone 4S when Stateside, and put its EU-sibling in my Nokia N9. When going overseas, the SIMs would swap phones. That way, my iPhone would always be my primary device to avoid racking up roaming charges eclipsing the national debt of certain countries, yet I would remain connected on both numbers.But although the N9 was great for a while, when Nokia chose to steer itself off a cliff by going Windows phone something else had to come instead. Yes, I did buy a Lumia 800, but I found it infuriating to use. I really tried to like it, but I couldn't. It looked like the N9, but that is where the analogies ended short from both being good at holding down paper. The N9 had to come out of the drawer again, but its total lack of apps made it no better than a feature phone albeit with one tenth of the battery life.So, not having used a Motorola since the Dynatac, this was quite a surprise! It is really fast, the screen is gorgeous - sharp with rich colors, the device is thin enough, the camera is quite ok, battery life is quite good, it is light enough, and, the phone is not too ugly. It is not an iPhone 6, which I did consider, but at one fourth the price I think it is certainly a lot better than you would expect. It's a black plasticky slab, but not worse than any Samsung out there.The camera low light performance is a bit better than the iPhone 4s, but the imaging algorithms are a little worse in bright light. Onboard memory is only a few gigs, but I stuck in a 32GB micro SD card I still had laying around and memory is no longer in short supply.It does not support LTE, but I tested download speeds north of 10Mbps and upload a little less than half that on a Finnish network. I assume it does not do HSPA-DC, which can give you here about 25Mbps down, but 10Mbps covers all my needs.It came out of the box with Android 4.4, but it apparently is Android 5 capable.It is good enough for me to start considering if I should reclassify my iPhone to secondary device and make this the primary one.",

It is my first time to use android system, new and excited so far.Update: I really don't know what is wrong with the phone. I put 32G card inside, and move all the apps which I can move to the SD card. Now is getting worse. It took pics so slow. And it had so many time of black screens on me when I tried to use the apps.",

Whatever.--------------------------------UPDATED AT 08/25/2015I've been using this phone for 6 months now, and I have several complaints. I'm not a tech expert but this phone is too slow, some apss suddenly just stop working when i'm using them, and one particular fact: the phone usually gets overheated if you use it for a long time (for example if you watch videos on Snapchat)I was happy with my phone, but now it's a pain in the ass.

            "comment": "Phone is incredibly slow and unusable at times. I don't know if it is an Android problem or a Moto problem. I have a 32GB extreme micro sd where I migrated all of my data and most of the apps to.  I also cleared the cache after upgrading to Lollipop, this seems to had made it a bit faster ( or less slow I should say ) but it is still crap. I used iPhone for several years and then got a Lumia 920, I would pick Microsoft again over these two anytime. I need a device that is responsive when I need it as I cannot afford missing calls and not being able to answer messages quickly because the damn phone is stuck in an infinite loop doing who knows what. I will probably give it away to one of my nephews so they can play with it and get another Lumia.UPDATE:  I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1 after discussing with friends about OS for smartphones. We all agreed Windows Phone is the most reliable and better designed of the three big players (although the least popular and \"cool\"). A friend pointed out he had used three different phones running Android, including a Galaxy, and it's crap compared to his $70 Lumia 635. So it's unfair to put all the blame on Motorola's engineers, the Moto G might be a good piece of hardware (looks like it is) running a crappy OS. But ultimately this review intends to warn and advise other consumers. I am not pro Microsoft, but in my experience they own the best OS for mobile right now, perhaps because they have control over both hardware and software development?.  Nexus vs Lumia would be a more fair comparison perhaps.  Anyway, I would not recommend this phone to anyone, for half the price you can get a device that is truly fast and reliable and won't get sluggish and need cold restarts every now and then.",

            "comment": "The main reasons I chose the Moto g were (1) price (2) specs for a budget phone and (3) prospect of receiving an android update. For less than $200 this phone definitely has great value. I will not be mentioning the specs in this review but definitely check out other reviews and/or tech review websites.Some cons so far (techie buyers beware):-screen shatters after a fall: this would be expected of any phone that falls unto a cement driveway BUT what I did not expect is shards of glass splinters. Luckily I had the plastic screen protector that originally came on the phone to stop the splinters from injuring my fingers. The underlying LCD screen remained intact however, the outer glass is the main culprit. At first I wanted to do the repair on my own by purchasing the outer glass on Amazon, but beware, it is close to impossible to only replace the outer glass without a full digitizer replacement as well. Some local repair shops wanted to charge upwards of $200 to fix the entire screen assembly which is crazy since the phone costs less.I have since contacted Motorola support to fix my device (really great customer service) and they charge $75 (physical damage) to replace the device.-NO OTA Android upgrades (if on smaller carriers): I switched from a major carrier to smaller Cricket Wireless after purchasing my moto G 2nd gen. I have seen tons of announcements online that Motorola was doing a OTA release to Android 5.0 but I still didnt receive my update notification. I even downloaded the Motorola device manager from their website but it kept on telling me that no update was available. When I finally contacted Motorola support (about the cracked screen mentioned above) they politely informed me that OTA updates are still linked to my carrier (which does NOT even carry the device). I am really disappointed that even though I purchased an unlocked US device from amazon, I am not eligible to get a software update because of my choice in carrier. Its like being linked to a contract all over again. I guess if I want a software update I have to go with a Google play experience phone instead of a Motorola with their (false) promise of a software upgrade.Apart from those issues the phone works well and Motorola has a good customer support line to provide answer no matter how infuriating they may be.",

This phone in short is incredible and hard to believe Motorola is selling it direct to the public unlocked for less then 200.00. This phone is a diamond in the rough and a win for any one that needs a good smartphone that can go head to head with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more on a contract from ATT, T-Mobile Verizon or Sprint. Motorola has taken what people actually want in a smartphone, refined it to work well, make it look cool, have good specs and be simple to use on any GSM network for the price.I was able to get this phone next day shipped for 8.99 with Amazon Prime. That is fantastic since NONE of the major phone providers in the USA carry this phone as of 11/2/14.Pros:Stock Android KitKat that is upgrading to Lollypop soon.Google Now integration right from the home button.Large 5' colorful screenSimple access to the sim cardFast processor that does not lagStereo speakersCamera that gets better rating then the Moto X.Expandable Micro SD card slot unlike it's cousin from last year.The phone works with any US/International GSM phone service providers.No bloatwear comes with the phone.The build quality is fantastic.Cons: (There are not many)Phone clips and cases are hard to find for the phone. The phone is larger then most phones so this is a problem.The NiteiZE x-large is one of the only cases I could find that fits the phone.No LTE supportThe back cover needs to have some grip to it since the phone is large to hold on one hand.The battery can't be removed.No major US service provider carry the phone. As of 11/2/14 you can only buy it direct from Motorola or on Amazon.This is a fantastic phone for people who want an awesome Android phone but not break the bank. If you have Cricket Wireless, Metro PCS or any GSM based phone provider consider this phone. Speed and function wise this phone is on par with anything from the major phone manufactures. This phone gives you all the specs and advantages of a phone that costs much more.",

            "comment": "This phone was my first purchase from Amazon Warehouse Deals. It was listed as \"like new\" condition, and the price was 20% below the cost of a new phone. The phone arrived in a sealed, undamaged retail box. It appeared to be brand-new; nothing missing, no signs of handling. So I endorse buying this \"like new\" from Warehouse Deals if you have the opportunity. You do sacrifice the device's 1-year warranty by purchasing it \"used,\" but unlocking the bootloader invalidates the warranty anyway.Migration from my old Android phone was pretty painless. Google and the Motorola Migration software will transfer virtually everything from an old Android phone, aside from apps that were not installed through Play Store. There is 5.5GB of internal storage space available. I installed a 32GB microSD card, unlocked the bootloader, installed TWRP recovery and rooted the phone. I plan to stick with the stock ROM for the foreseeable future and use Xposed for mods.To conserve battery life, both generations of the Moto G are very dim with the default auto brightness settings. I don't like that, so I used GravityBox in Xposed to significantly increase the brightness. Display accuracy seems to vary greatly from one phone to another, but FWIW, these are measurements taken on my Moto G:Contrast ratio: 1,555:1Average color temperature (20% - 100%): 6855KGamma: 2.69Grayscale average dE: 4.07Color Checker average dE: 4.39Max brightness: 376 cd/m2 (110 fL)The contrast is typical for an LCD smartphone display, and the color accuracy is fair. All primary and secondary colors have pretty accurate hue, except for red and magenta. All are undersaturated, except for magenta. Although it measured high, the gamma looks good in actual use. The coolness of the color temperature and undersaturation of colors are noticeable, but the display looks pretty good overall.The speakers are an improvement over other phones I've had, but I don't have any experience with the acclaimed HTC \"BoomSound\" phones.  Although the speakers sound pretty good (by phone standards), their volume is about average. Using the Pyxis ringtone, I measured my 2nd gen Moto G, a 1st gen Moto G and an HTC Sensation all face-up on a desk next to my sound meter. Although the Sensation sounded the quietest to my ears (from a greater distance than the sound meter), it measured about the same loudness as the 2nd gen Moto G. The original Moto G was clearly the loudest, measuring about 10 dB higher than the other phones (~100 vs. ~90).I'm not much of a photog, so I don't have much to say about the camera. Pictures are okay, I guess. It takes videos in only 720p, and the video quality seems pretty lousy.I'm on the fence about the size of this phone. I can appreciate having such a large screen, but this phone is really pushing the limits of what I feel is an acceptable size for a phone. I think I might have preferred if Motorola had used a 4.7\" or 4.8\" screen and kept the size of the phone closer to the original Moto G. The LG G2 mini, for example, has a 4.7\" screen and is roughly the same size as the 1st gen Moto G.Pros+ Obviously, the price+ Pure AOSP combined with Xposed and GravityBox is a wonderfully trouble-free (mostly) Android experience. This is a delight after years of using buggy CM-based ROMs on other phones.+ microSD support+ Decent, front-facing stereo speakers+ Pretty decent display quality with a color temperature that is (thankfully) under 7000K, but display quality surely varies+ FM radio - rarely found in phones these days, and although I admittedly don't use it very often, I do like to have the optionCons- Low-end CPU, GPU and RAM, none of which are upgrades from the 1st gen Moto G- The sealed battery is more difficult and costly to replace than a \"user-replaceable\" battery. I just replaced a battery in one of my other phones for $5. OEM Moto G batteries are selling for over $20, and some phone disassembly is required to replace them.- No 4G, NFC, MHL or IR, but I really don't care about any of that- Poor quality video capture- Included charger has an integrated cable and is only 550mA",

            "comment": "I bought this phone on December 3rd and it was delivered way before time on December 6th. Ive been using it ever since as my daily driver to replace my old unlocked HTC One X AT&T.This is a great value device. Right out of the box you can feel the premium quality material that the phone is made up from. This is stock android 4.4.4 OS and android lollipop is a guaranteed update. (I'm in the Caribbean now and checking once in a while for the lollipop update but nada! ) Today Ive already received gallery, camera and other motorola specific software updates...The only major flaw I'm experiencing with it is that I found it to have a poor battery life. Even if I use it in a moderate manner I'll still have to charge it twice a day. Its seems that the screen is using all the power because the battery manager always shows the display to be using 48% or 50% even 73% of the charge. This is the reason why im giving it 4 stars...Hope a software update will fix this.Update: Wednesday, December 31, 2014Out of nowhere my phone doesn't turn on.After spending a quiet day with it once back home tonight I put it to charge. After a while I decided to check something in it while it was connected to a power source. This is when I realize the battery icon indicates that the phone is plugged but was not charging. I Checked the power cord the phone came with but it doesn't seem to have any problem because  I use it on another phone and it works fine. I even tried another charger but nothing.I am so disappointed. I have all my stuff in it (pictures, videos, contacts etc.. that haven't backed up yet. Now I have no choice its now 2stars. The phone didn't even last a full month.Unfortunately I am returning it...",

            "comment": "The value that is found here is outstanding. This phone is unlocked - it works on nearly ever GSM network in the entire world. SIM chips are easily changeable, meaning you can buy plans and SIM chips at will and use this phone as you please. No restrictions. No contract. No more financing your phone as if it were a car.Samsung phones are great, but they're $650. Apple phones are great, but they're $650+. Personally I prefer the Android operating system because I have more control and it is more customizable. In this Moto G you have, essentially, all the features of a $650 phone for a small price of $180. Except, this one is unlocked. One more caveat - since it only has 1GB of RAM it doesn't handle multitasking between 3+ apps like high-priced phones can. But, really, are you that needy? Is what you're doing really THAT important? Is the enslavement to a 2 year contract worth the difference in multitasking performance? Is locking yourself into a contract AND a provider with your phone choice worth the difference? For me it wasn't. I like to have a decent camera to capture memories, funny videos, etc. I like to have a phone that can make quality calls on provider networks AND over wifi with Android apps. I like a phone that I can use to text people - easily and efficiently. A phone that I can check my email on. A phone I can add space to (mini SD card). This is that phone. And luckily it's only $180. I'm not stuck in any contract - I can do literally whatever I want. Forget the thumbprint readers, the smile detections, the big megapixel number, the multitasking of a desktop, and the screen resolution of a 50\" TV, get this, save money, and truly own and control what is yours.",

            "comment": "The phone keeps freezing. It's very unreliable. Sometimes it won't unlock, apps freeze and restarting doesn't help. I've even taken the battery out, but it starts up frozen.  Doesn't happen all the time, but at least a few times a week. Today my alarm was going off in a meeting and I couldn't turn it off. I had to power down the phone. I restarted when I got out and then I couldn't unlock the screen. I finally got it unlocked and then my google maps wouldn't let me choose my location and I had to wait several minutes before I could navigate my way home.Daling with their customer service is a nightmare. Last week, online chat support had me pressing and holding the power and volume buttons for 3 full minutes and then told me to press the power key, which set it back to step one. This was repeated with the same result. Spent 20 minutes to accomplish nothing before calling their support number. They emailed me me instructions for troubleshooting. Turns out you only need to hold the keys for 3 SECONDS and then press the volume button. Troubleshooting process fails at step 5..tried it at least 10 times. After wasting another big chunk of time with another service rep who had to put me on hold every time I asked a question, I finally asked to speak to a supervisor, which was useless since he only repeated the same scripted responses.  I told him about the discrepancy with the troubleshooting process, and re said they have \"different logic process.\" I said they prob had typo nobody had the sense to recognize. He did not agree. So now they want to charge me a premium fee to replace a defective product.",

            "comment": "I received the phone well on time. Mine is a US GSM white model. I was skeptical at first about the performance and overall experience, but I am glad I was wrong.The phone is absolutely fantastic for its price. The performance as well the quality stand out.Firstly, the software. The pure android (almost). Motorola provides the stock android with very very few but useful apps (like Motorola Migrate).As a result, the phone is able to handle everything you throw at it. It almost performs on par with the likes of flagship phones. That being said, it will surely won't let you down. The quad core processor does its job pretty well. I never saw the phone lag at any point.Secondly, the storage. It comes with a standard 8GB memory. However, you have a micro-SD slot to increase the limited memory.Thirdly, the battery life. The phone lasts at least a day with normal usage. For people who are continuously chatting and calling and playing games, the battery will not last long enough. Apart from that, it will serve you well.Overall, at such a price point, its a killer. You will not go wrong if you are thinking of buying it.P.S.: This is not a 4G phone. The max it supports is UMTS/HSPA+. But if you are not a heavy user, you do not need 4G then. The speeds will be good enough. Mine has a T-Mobile service and it runs smooth without issues.Buy US model if you are in USA, otherwise if you travel a lot internationally, then Global model will better suit you.",

            "comment": "Bought the Global GSM version (black). It works smoothly on AT&T HSPA network. I saw a lot of people asked T-Mo but few asked ATT... So I would like to point this out...I am satisfied with the downstream speed, as for non-video-streaming usual use, like Google Map, checking email, browsing websites like Amazon, using shopping and banking apps, etc. Upstream is a bit tight, in my opinion. I user dropbox to sync photos, and it takes much longer than my HTC One on AT&T LTE network (as expected).I like the screen size. Resolution is on the lower side compared with other new phones these days. I can also notice some diagonal stripes on the screen when looking from certain angles when the screen is on -  I am not saying those touch-sensing cell traces when the screen is off. It doesn't bother me but I am sure some people will get annoyed by these stripes.Battery life is good. I still had 40% left after normal use (browsing, like G+ & FB, texting, using maps, taking couple pictures here and there) from 9am to 11pm yesterday. I did not play games,although I watched roughly 30 minutes of videos, and made a couple 20+ minutes phone calls.... It was on WiFi for most of the time. Bluetooth was on all day.I also really like the non-slip back cover. It doesn't feel cheap in hand like many other plastic phones. My biggest complaint on the HTC M7 was that it wouldn't stay in my hand... I like the metal feeling, but I had to put on sleeve to keep it in my hand in dry winter days!",

After searching for a replacement I found the the Nexus 5 was no longer available and the Nexus 6 is too expensive for this college girl. I was hesitant to buy the Moto G (2nd gen)  at first, $180 for a no contract smartphone, whats the catch? However, I am so happy I took the chance the Moto G can keep up with some of the best smartphones out there.Like most college students I spend lots and lots of time on my phone. The Moto G was able to keep up with all the texting, talking, email, twitter, pinterest, etc. with little to no lag time.The screen looks great - I would say better than my nexus 4. Even on a very low brightness it looks awesome.Battery life is leaps and bounds better than the Nexus 4. I am able to go all day (about 8am when I leave for work until 9pm when I get home from school) without charging my phone while still using it all day. *I do have the screen set to a low brightness and am not constantly on the phone the whole day, but I would say I use my phone more than the average person.I love that the phone is completely unlocked! So easy to switch carriers and find the best prices with out the crazy prices.Overall an amazing phone at an amazing price. Highly recommended.",

I knew what to expect feature-wise, before I got it, but was particularly impressed with the build quality. I came from a Samsung Galaxy S3, which was a great phone, but lacked a \"solid\" feeling with its plastic body. The Moto G has a plastic body but feels great in the hand, with the grippy exterior that doesn't show fingerprints. It has survived several small drops unscathed, and I don't have a case on it (I don't recommend dropping it, just saying that it's durable).On top of the features and solid build quality - there are prompt Android updates! Previously, you could only expect this for Nexus phones and a handful of high-end phones. Kudos to Motorola for providing this level of support to the lower end of the smartphone market. The Android experience on the Moto G in general is great - stock as far as I can tell.On the negative side, there are only 8 GB of onboard storage space - fortunately there is a microSD slot, so the small onboard storage is less of an issue. The phone also lacks 4G, but honestly, I've barely noticed it unless I'm downloading a large file while not in range of wifi (which is rare). On the positive side on the network, it has wifi hotspot enabled by default.",

So I bought the Global GSM version as it is written that it should work with GSM carriers. I tried with both AT&T (PureTalk) and T-Mobile (BYO wireless) and none of them worked! Strangely, my old sim card from Europe was working, roaming on AT&T network... but it wouldn't work on the PureTalk simcard. I spent a lot of time with customer service of BYO and PureTalk and their final answer was that the phone was the source of the problem. To their credit, their sim worked with phones of friends.So I sent it back and got the US version. It works with both carriers. Yay... but it won't work in Europe.Something very puzzling about the global GSM phone I got was the inscription on the bottom left of the back (fater removing the case): it was writen CDMA. Strange for a GSM phone right? On the US version it's written AWS instead.I feel a bit frustrated not having the global GSM working here. Does anyone think I might have gotten a CDMA version that was bound not to work (but there was a SIM card slot, so it's GOT to be GSM and not CDMA right?)? I.e any chance it was a one time mistake and I could try again geting a global GSM one or am I wasting my time? Did anyone get a global GSM working with T-mobile or AT&T in California?",

Despite having better specs the flagship phone is considerably slower and just unpleasant to use compared to the Moto G.  So far I like the phone, and am getting around 8 megs of speed in my area even without LTE which is plenty fast for any normal use.  Screen is nice, bright and responsive, even outside.  Fits in hand and pocket nicely, with no need for case or anything like that.  Has a built in FM radio tuner which is super cool and a throwback to the first smartphones.  The speakers are superb in my opinion for a cell phone.Have to subtract one star for lack of LTE though, even though HSPA+ is plenty fast enough there really is no excuse to release a phone in 2014 without an LTE radio.  8 gigs is also quite a low amount of storage, SD card support (although nice) is no substitute for on board storage.  Would have gladly paid more for LTE and more storage.",

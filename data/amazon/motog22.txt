Both cost roughly as much as this (at least when the Fire Phone is on sale, as it often is).However, for the typical user who doesn't use Prime, who likes pure Android, who doesn't have a use for dual SIMs, and who can recharge every night, the Moto G is absolutely my recommendation. I got it for my daughter, who keeps it in\u00a0this case\u00a0and who loves it. The fact it is splash-resistant is a huge plus, for everyone but especially for kids. The dual front-facing stereo speakers sound great, and media looks fantastic on the large screen. 8GB is pretty mediocre, but the fact you can easily expand that with a cheap microSD card makes up for it.It's stable, well-designed, well-made, and \"just works.\"",

I never got a smart phone before because of the high cost, this is 200 bucks and 45 a month for the 3gig service  , beat that, actually the big phone company's are starting to offer similar plans ( out of the goodness of their heart )In the us Make sure you are ordering the us version and gen2,  the android updated to the latest version automatically on the first day.May I suggest the fosmon case, it's military grade and fits like a glove",

After some weeks of using the phone I have to say I don't regret on buying it and I'd recommend it (I already did) over any Samsung Phone on the same price Tier (maybe even higher tiers)Camera it's not a top-notch one off course, but it works decently on natural light conditions, you can't ask for more for what you're paying.The phone it's really responsive for its price range: vanilla android makes it fast and fluid, and it's upgradeable to the latest android version (5.0 Lollipop) already. Battery duration it's optimal: unless you're gaming you can last a whole day with moderate usage.Built Quality seems sturdy, and phone itself so heavy so you can add a protective case without making it so heavy.",

Fortunately I have more than one (old cell phones)...I'm using it 4 days ago and the battery is nice, today I've shared music through bluetooth to my car for about 2 hour, full volume; then in the job i was listening music from cell, maybe 4 hours(wifi enabled), navigate about 1 hour...at the end of the day cell battery consumption was less then 25%. It's fast, no lags. But it's not too good, transfering files (e.g. 16 of multimedia file) from PC through an usb cable is so slow (less than 1MB/s), but if you transfer files to the sd card directly (or using an usb adapater) all is ok. All in all I'm happy with the product (and the price), I only need it to call an receive calls, to listen to music and navigate, i don't have time to play games. I recommend it.",

            "comment": "This is an excellent phone for the money, and is probably the best budget Android smartphone on the market.  It has a very good 5 inch 720p IPS screen, very good sound with dual front speakers, decent front and rear cameras, a quad-core processor, and an SD card slot.  It feels solid and substantial in the hand.  To Motorola's credit, the Moto G is delivered with an almost completely stock Android 4.4.4 KitKat, with only a few Motorola apps added.  The lack of any UI alterations to Android is a plus, as the phone is snappy and very responsive with no lagging.  Phone call quality is very good.  Battery life is better than expected, and easily gets me though a day.  Although the phone lacks LTE, I'm getting HSPA+ speeds that are more than acceptable (10 Mbps at times), so the lack of LTE is not an issue for me.  My phone was upgraded to Android 5.0.1 Lollipop in December 2014, and while the upgrade from KitKat was not a revelation, it's a more refined experience, and I'm quite pleased. Another phone I considered was the Nexus 5.  While it has a screen with more pixels, LTE, and a faster processor, the Nexus unfortunately lacks an SD card slot, and also runs close to twice the price!",

I may never buy a 4G battery draining phone again.The battery on my phone has lasted OVER 2 days at times and usually at least a day.If I am using it heavy, none stop for hours on end in bed it still last longer than my S3 ever did.I will say I do not play games on my phone. Who does that? I have an XBOX for such things.So as far as performance I am basing it on texting, dating apps, internet browsing, Youtube Videos, camera, Instagram and so on.Not Battlefield 4.I will say I do NOT like Android Lollipop 5.2 that it upgraded to. Came with KitKat which I was used to and liked.If you search around you'll see many complaints about Lollipop so you may want to hold of on the update.",

I opted for Advance exchange program from Moto support. 7 days after the RMA was opened no phone yet, I called back and they did not ship as they did not have a replacement to send. Very nice of Motorola to keep this information to themselves. Now they say they have a while version of Moto G (original phone was Black) and will send that.. I said OK, whatever just send it. Got replacement phone  end of Jan.Last week after full charge, phone decided to die. Nothing but black screen (would not turn on). Only response was a vibrate motion when I long press the power key. No choice but to open another RMA with Motorola. Same process, I opt for Advance exchange program expecting to have a replacement phone in 3-4 days. Well, they send confirmation email with a $75 repair estimate. They are treating this as an out of warranty repair even though the phone is registered though Motorola support site and should warranty to Feb 2016. Motorola does not seem to know what they are doing. I will add further updates as I deal with them. What a waste of time.Motorola CSR agents have been very helpful, but the amount of time I spent on the RMA is disappointing to say the least.UPDATE - Motorola wants to send Global GSM as replacement for my US unlocked as they do not have stock for the US unlocked. I will update the review once I get the phone.- Sent email to Motorola  3 weeks ago as per suggestion from the rep who answered my review. No response to the email. I guess it is great as long as you do not have to deal with support issues.",

            "comment": "Bought my Global GSM version Moto G 2nd Gen directly from Motorola. Shipped from Shenzhen on Friday and arrived at my house Monday morning.I had done some research but frankly there are some confusing aspects to this device and Motorola's info for it. I am on a T-mobile $30/month prepaid plan (which sadly I believe has been discontinued for new customers) so I needed a phone that would work with their network but I also travel frequently enough out of the country that I wanted a phone that would be compatible with the networks in the places I am going. I have no idea how much more expensive it is to add a radio that covers all of the frequencies, but it would seem to really simply manufacturing to just have one GSM model. After poking around the internet it seemed likely to me that the Global version would work fine on the T-mobile network where I live here in the DC area since they use the 1900 freq for HSPA+ here. Ultimately I was proven correct as the phone works fine here. I just took the SIM out of my Nexus 4 and moved it to the G and it worked right away.Speaking of SIM's I was under the impression that all of the Global version phones had dual SIM slots after reading reviews from the UK and elsewhere. However, my phone has only one SIM slot. I contacted Motorola customer service and they told me that this is correct. Any G sold in the US (whether it is the global version or the US version) will only have one SIM slot. This seems strange to me as well. Why bother with all of these different designs and versions? It's not a huge issue, but I will have to take a little case along on my travels to keep track of my SIM.The experience of the phone is not much different from my Nexus 4. Apps seem to open fast enough for me. There's no problems that I have encountered. I was concerned that the larger screen would be too big, but in operation it doesn't seem that much larger. The icons are certainly bigger and due to the pixel density they are not quite as crisp, but the differences are fairly negligible.Having the micro SD card slot is a very welcome feature. I had a 16GB card from another old phone that I put in this one. My music is all stored there and many of the apps installed there as well. When the phone itself only has 8GB of space this is really a necessity.One of the nice things about the Andoid environment is that all I needed to do was log in to my Google account and the phone automatically started downloading my apps with no intervention from me. That made setting the phone up rather easy since most of my apps just installed on their own. Although I suppose that it could have been the old apps were installed on the SD card and they were just auto updating or installed from the card. I did have to manually add several so that seems likely? Since I was coming from a KitKat environment on the Nexus 4 there was no difference to operation.Overall I am extremely impressed by the quality of this phone. For a relatively basic user like me, it is great to not have to spend several hundred dollars on flagship hardware I don't need. For $180 you get an unlocked phone that has plenty of power for most users. I mainly use it to stream internet radio at work and in the car and basic email, FB, etc. The BT audio works perfectly with my car's audio system.Battery life seems to be a huge improvement so far over the N4. After the KitKat update my N4 was essentially killed. Fast battery drain. Overheating. It was a nightmare trying to get anything out of the phone. I am hoping that I don't encounter any similar issues with the Moto G when the Android L update happens.",

The second generation is a relatively large improvement on the original Moto G. The near vanilla Android runs very smooth and is wonderfully simple, accompanied by very well designed Motorola hardware. Contrary to popular belief, the lesser specs are far from being a problem. Yes they are limited in comparison to the top dog phones on the market today, but they are definitely more than enough to complete many, if not all of your tasks. The screen looks fantastic, the aesthetics are absolutely flawless and it simply feels wonderful to the hand. The battery life is much better than most other phones available, even with the larger screen than the original. The battery size doesn\u2019t appear to be as influential as many would prefer to believe. With the arrival of the soon to come Android update, there is suppose to be yet an even further increase in improving battery life.Oh, and then there\u2019s the addition of the MicroSD card slot... How many well designed, inexpensive phones have that below there belts? :)",

            "comment": "Ok, I switched from Nexus 4, a pretty good phone, so this review is also a comparison to Nexus 4:1) screen size - not that much bigger than Nexus' 4.7, but the more I use it, the more I like it.  5 Inches is good for using the phone as a GPS/ watch movies and at the same time it still fits in the pocket.2) resolution - the colors are vibrant, even though the resolution is not that great.  I set it to \"Auto\" and it is good enough to see both in the evening and during daytime.3) Micro SD card slot - is a beautiful thing, easy to reach on this phone, I bought a Samsung micro SD card here on Amazon, pretty inexpensive.4) sound - using T-Mobile, I did notice that I have to set the call volume high, but I can still hear the other person clearly.  Alarms/music/movies sound good.5) Internet speeds - On T-Mobile, I mostly get H, and sometimes H+ and 3G, and pages load faster than on Nexus 4.6) Camera - MUCH better than on Nexus 4, makes good shots even in low light conditions.  Images can be a little fuzzy, but the colors are true.7) Battery - also MUCH better than on Nexus 4, easily lasts a day with moderate/heavy use; takes 1.5 hours to get a full charge.8) Build quality - very good, does not look/feel cheap.9) the only thing I noticed is a tiny lag when returning to the home screen, about 1 second that it takes widgets/apps on the home screen to load.Bottom line - for the money, this is a very good unlocked phone and an excellent value.  People even mistake it for a Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes, that's how good it looks!Update - December 21Im still very much impressed with the phone, just wanted to add a couple of things I noticed:1) It now takes a little longer to charge from 0 to 100% - 2 hours versus 1.5 when new;2) The battery doesnt last as long, as when I bought it, but still close to a full day with moderate/heavy use; pages load just a bit slower;3) The camera is really very good.  I had a chance to compare it with that of the new Moto X, and Moto G's camera is definitely better, colors are true and vibrant;4) Motorola's support is great - lately my phone was not always charging, when connected to a charger, and sometimes a call would drop, and when I called Motorola, I was able to arrange for a free replacement, prepaid mailing label and all;I would buy it again...And of course, the fact that the phone is water-resistant is an added bonus!",

            "comment": "Of course everyone's cell phone needs will be different, so take this list of \"I do\"s of the things I do with my phone.I DO:TextWebShort phone callsTwitterCamera (occasionally)NavigationSkypeGmailListen to music... and that's pretty much it, for about 98% of my usage. I never use my phone for games. I only rarely watch videos. I'm not a multimedia-heavy phone user. Bear in mind that my perspective on this phone will only be useful if your phone activities are roughly the same as mine.For about the last year, I was using a Nexus 4. I loved it to death, but it suffered increasingly short battery life and would overheat if the screen was on for more than a few minutes. I saw that the 2014-edition of the Moto G was selling for a piddly $180 *off contract* and *unlocked*. Given the phone's specs, that is utterly too good to be true.... except, it's true.I don't even know how they got this hardware down to sell this cheaply. The 720p resolution on the 5\" screen is crisp for navigating UIs, web pages, entering text, and just about any other non-media thing you could imagine. The screen itself is bright and the colors pop nicely. The phone's size is a nice balance: big enough to offer gummy buttons and links that are easy-to-click, and not so big that it would tear your hands in half like some newer phablets.The phone has only 1GB of RAM, but for the above uses I listed, I've never noticed a single hiccup or stutter. Everything is zippy and flowing.An unexpected bonus is the stereo front-facing speakers. Instead of blasting sounds out the back like too many phones and tablets do, this one shoots the sound *toward* you.The camera is... okay. I'm not a photography nut, so both the front-and-rear cameras are fine for the occasional novelty snap.I'm highly pleased that the phone has a microSD card slot - a thing which too many Android phones are giving up these days.The installation of Android is a nearly-sterile copy of Kitkat 4.4.4, with just one or two Motorola customizations thrown in. These are easily ignored if you want to enjoy the otherwise pure Android experience.It's true, the phone doesn't have LTE, but I'm angry at how that service is sold from the big US carriers anyway. Instead the phone supports the next-best thing, HSPA+, which is perfectly fine for the things I use. The radio seems better than the one in my old Nexus 4, as the G gets slightly better reception in the same scenarios.In sum, this phone feels like a killer bargain. It meets my needs, cost not much at all, and doesn't bind me to a carrier or a contract. Can we say \"win\"? Why yes, I think so.",

            "comment": "I've been using this phone as my driver for about two weeks now, so I think I can comment on how well it works for that purpose. It's a snappy little device that rarely slows down on me (but yes, it does slow down from time to time). I use a lot of apps and I haven't found one that it hasn't been able to run well yet. The device itself feels fairly solid, although it's a bit hefty, and the display looks far better than what you would expect in this price range. The somewhat low PPI is only visible is you look for it, or hold the device close.Having owned a Lumia 720 with Windows Phone 8.1 before this, I will say that I haven't found the switch to be (even slightly) jarring. There are specific features that I do miss (the Lumia camera apps, long battery life*, double tap screen to wake the phone), but others that I thought I would miss and didn't (Cortana**). In addition, I'm spoiled by wider selection of apps that are available for KitKat.*In terms of battery life, this phone is a disappointment. My expectations might be too high coming from the 720, but this thing can barely make it through the day before needing a charge. Sometimes, I'm reaching for the charger by 5pm (from around 6 or 7am). I tried turning off the WiFi when I'm not using it, setting the GPS in battery saving mode, and setting the screen to turn off after a very short period.**Google Now is a more than capable replacement for Cortana. While Google Now doesn't really do Cortana's chit chat, it can handle just about anything else that Cortana does. I'm very pleased with it.Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low cost Android device that can handle your business.Pros:* Great value* Excellent app selection* Snappy performance 90% of the time* Not an eyesoreCons:* Disappointing battery life* The keyboard slows down occasionally, making it hard to type.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone to replace a Nexus 4 that is having issues with the ringer ... and I need my phone for work. I really want more of a phablet (maybe 5.5 inch screen) but bought this to tide me over until I decide what I really want to buy (off contract). For me it was worth paying a few extra dollars when comparing this phone to the no-name ones. I almost bought the Huawei Ascend Mate 2 but a 6.1\" screen was just too large for me.I got this in on the morning of September 19, 2014, and have been using it heavily ever since. In comparison to the Nexus 4 the specs and performance are very similar. My wife told me that the call quality is better on the Moto G and I have noticed that the Bluetooth is more stable. Overall this is a great phone for $179.00 off contract. If you must have the latest and greatest then shell out $600.00 - $700.00 for the latest top line phone, or sign a two-year contract and lock in that high monthly service price. Bearing in mind the bargain basement price I offer the following opinions:Pro: Build quality (not pretty but solid), WI-FI hotspot (try that with your locked stock phone), FM radio, apparently unlimited app screens (I gave up after 10), decent battery life (I watched almost 3 hours of Netflix this morning and the battery lost 48%), very decent screen resolution (the same as the Nexus 4 but at a slightly lower pixel count with the larger screen), stereo speakers (WAY louder than the Nexus 4 ... :-), camera is 8 MP like the Nexus 4 but the pbotos are much clearer, call quality, micro SD card slot, \"pure\" Android 4.4.4 experience (basically identical to the Nexus 4 so no learning curve), guaranteed upgrade of the operating system, Gorilla Glass 3, ease of migrating apps and etc. between old and new phones, and 5\" screen size compared to many bargain phones' screens.Con: 1 GB ram (although I have yet to experience a hiccup), no LTE (but I have measured download speeds of around 2 megs of data per second with the HSPA +), 8 GB storage, an incredibly slippery back (and there's not much case wise to choose from right now), cheapo buttons, and lousy auto-brightness calibration. The auto-brightness is just not useable as shipped so you have to set brightness manually.Summary: Unless you are a power user or a phone snob this phone will very probably suit you just fine.Moto G (2nd Generation) US version White",

Well, if you are looking to be in a smartphone conversation, with all andriod have to offer while staying on a tight budget. this phone is for you. Initially I was suprised on the quality of this phone that I wondered if Amazon sent me the right phone or  if they sent the phone to me in an error because the phone was way beyond my imagination and  for  $179? thats not a deal to pass by.  About me, average user, check emails and phone calls not into apps and all that so i couldnt give you the details** I  ******* Also a quick note here, if you are trying to buy  the wooden case by skinomi; Note; that is not an actual case its just like a sticker. I am not trying to give the seller a bad review or bad mouth their product but to make sure other buyers read their posting very well. they did state on their  posting though but I was too excited about how pretty the sticker(case) looks that i did not read the full listing- it looks pretty on the phone tho.",

(not 2G as said in the ad...VERY fast), the Mobile Hotspot works (unlike the 1st generation version that I tried), the screen is not so large that its hard to hold it...I can thumb across the screen without truly stretching or straining.  Rarely, it doesn't respond to my tap even though my hands and screen are pretty clean.  Other than that, it has been absolutely wonderful and without glitches.  I had to resize text on webpages with the smaller 1st generation...the size is fine on this one and FYI the icons are 3x larger even though the size different of the phones is minor.  Seems to be on the light-weight side for its size, plastic backing, non-removable battery (I haven't tested its longevity yet), very slight muffled sound to calls...not a crystal clear sound but not an issue at all.  The volume rocker button is too small for my tastes (eg. you can press up when you intended down).I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I'll leave it at 5 stars for now but reduce a star if anything more negative arises.",

At first I thought the camera, with its 2 separate picture editing programs turned out the best photographs I've seen.  But as I realized much later, with the 2 programs and an awful lot of work, I was only improving pictures taken with a very mediocre camera to close to what they would have been if taken with a better one.  And then I would still have to use Photoshop to make most of them at least acceptable.  Another draw back, as with all cell phones, is that the pictures looked great on the phone but once I put them on my computer, no where near as good, with many, thanks to all the effects these programs supply, looking even worseUPDATE: The only drawback to the Moto G2 is that it's a Google phone, and the more I edit pictures, the more often a notice comes on the screen saying, \"Google has stopped working,\" and all of my work is deleted.  And thanks to a recent camera upgrade, the selective focusing and spot meter are next to impossible to use.  It also freezes, which means I have to shut it off, wait, and then turn it back on.  If it weren't for the camera I would give it 3 stars.  All in all, however, it's still much better than the S4.",

Can't find anywhere to adjust in the OS.  Processor is old gen and only 1.2 GHz, yes it's still a quad core but a slower one.",

Multi-tasking is just ok with 1GB of RAM, however that's to be expected. With Lollipop 5.0.2 it really does very respectably well given the hardware limitations. If you are looking in this price range, this phone should definitely be on the short list.I compared this with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and despite the Note's better camera and battery life, I ended up returning the Note because this phone is actually BETTER in day-to-day use. Particularly if you use Google's apps heavily like I do. Hangouts on the Note 4 is a stuttering nightmare, whereas on the Moto G it's silky smooth. In the end this phone was just more enjoyable to use, especially once I got the Lollipop update.",

(The Galaxy Line of Notes and S' and all that jazz, the LG G 2 & 3, iPhone 4-6+) and this phone is exceptional for being considered a \"midrange, budget smartphone\" its smooth, speedy, and sounds great.I bought it from a seller named JP mobiles, and I got it used for $140 and it was in \"very good condition\" but they were wrong. It is in \"LIKE NEW condition\".All that to say, very satisfied with my purchase and very satisfied with Motorola's latest budget phone.",

I love the camera both rear and the  front camera which provides good picture/video quality, the user interface is also awesome considering the fact that the phone has 1 GB RAM, and I've seen other phones online with more RAM but still lags behind in user interface, so phone specs don't necessarily equal the user experience. The other impressive thing about the phone is that it is Global GSM, so I believe you can use it outside of the US. The cons of this phone are the non removable battery, also the charge easily drains up in 1 day for moderate use, and not quite impressive speed in surfing the web compared to other smartphones. To sum it up my opinion is  This is a good budget smartphone, No extravagance spending!  (\"quality on the cheap price\")",

The absence of Samsung added software and all attendant bloatware (both by Verizon and Samsung) actually allows the Moto G to function more quickly/slickly than my fully loaded S5.  Glitch free screen transitions, movement from one app to the next Great call quality, screen size, usability. An altogether good feel.Phone is definitely plasticy but has nice heft, good built quality and is nicely contoured.  Camera and video is good, not great.If you are looking for tight integration into the google ecosystem, nice build for an attractive price, this phone is an easy choice.  I am going to buy an extra one for myself as a backup.",

I was able to capture amazing shots in daylight.I think the front camera is also decent. The big screen was perfect for watching YouTube videos. Although the phone doesn't have 4G LTE,the 3G and WiFi do a good job. Browsing is fast and video streaming (by which I mean YouTube) streams smoothly without glitches which adds to the big screen experience. I think it's best for the price of $180 when I bough it. Trust me - I did at least 2-3 hours of research comparing this one with others like recent Lumia phones, LG G3, HTC and other budget phones. This one had the best reviews though the other brands sport one or other better features like 4G or 13 MP camera. In hindsight, the reviews were correct. Go Moto!",

They got a new SIM card at their carrier and that was it.  It is an amazing phone.  The phone is very fast, no bloating at all, stock Android.  Worked as described, data, wi-fi, cell.  Fantastic camera, and camera software.  I was very impressed how amazing this phone is at the price point.  Hopefully the price point remains the same or very, very similar.  It's nice to have these type of phones available for folks who want quality without breaking the bank.  I highly recommend this phone.  I have a Nexus 5, and this phone hung there like a champ with mine.  If my Nexus broke, I would replace it with this phone right away.",

Camera takes great pics inside, in direct sunlight the photos are a tad overexposed but this is very nitpicky. The phone is fast to surf with, the normal stuff like facebook, youtube, google news, twitter and reddit all work as fast as my cable modem. The wifi works well when I have tried it. No problem finding hotspots or with speed. I played with my friends'  IPhones and this seems to do pretty much everything that that the Apple product does and just as fast. I am sure there are bells and whistles that are missing compared to IPhone 6s or Samsung's newest but for a first time user this works great and I am completely satisfied.",

Never got the update on the phone even though it was announced that this model qualified for the update. The phone itself was very nice, I was going to use it as my back up phone, but decided that I should wait for the LTE version and returned this one.Having been on using an Android phone and now having used iPhones the last few years, it's good to see that Android is getting better but ultimately I really liked the product but didn't love it. I'm kind of interested in the Nexus 6 at this point.",

Great color, very good pictures, it was easy for me to learn to use, & phone sound is good.  It is compact, not a phablet.  With only phone calls, battery lasts two days.  If you check mail or play games, then needs recharging daily.  I live in Panama, so this works well here!  I go back & forth to the U.S., & changing SIM cards very easy.  I hope to keep this a little longer than the last!",

I was excited to have it, and I enjoyed using it during the first month, but my experience had changed completely from the second month onward (been having it for half a year now). Apart from the amazing screen, everything else is not up-to-standard. My major complain here is that the phone is very slow. I had reset it to the factory setting three times already because it became to slow to operate. Almost everyday that the screen freezes on me and that I would have to soft reset the phone by forcing it to close which means forcing all my unsaved apps to close. The battery life is also very poor. I don't know what to say about this product except disappointing.",

I initially put a PIN to lock my phone but every time i entered the PIN to unlock, the screen would blink for a second and return to being locked. I would have to keep entering the PIN as much as ten times consecutively for the phone to unlock. I decided to remove the pin and leave a swipe to unlock screen. The same problem persisted. I have to swipe, then press the power button and swipe again and keep doing it over and over until it decides to unlock. The phone locks in the middle of running apps, trying to make a call, trying to send messages etc. I have tried removing all downloaded apps, installing antivirus software, hard resetting but nothing has changed.",

I loved the curves on the first gen Moto G & I'm glad they kept that design aesthetic for this new Moto G. 2014 has been a year of huge phones and even Moto G wasn't left off as the move from 4.5inch to 5inch display plus the two front facing speakers adding the chin size has made it a somewhat large phone but Motorola did a great job doing all that in a compact package that doesn't feel as large(thumbs up for that).The software experience on my old Moto G was smooth & seamless & that's the main reason I love the Moto G and couldn't resist upgrading to the 2nd gen Moto G which has already impressed me very much & now I'm looking forward to the software experience after I upgrade to Android L.",

The specs on this phone are just amazing for the price your gunna pay and honestly I don't miss have LTE at all. Saying that I do have at&t and their 4g and LTE are pretty much the same speed I can't say that for T-Mobile or any other gsm carriers but on at&t its still fast even without the LTE. The cameras on this phone are great plus you get guaranteed android updates for 18 months so pretty much as soon as you open the box you are able to update to lollipop. I have nothing bad to say about this phone other than they could've added more moto x features on it but thats just me nit picking but honestly if you were to buy this phone you won't regret it",

I inserted my T-mobile nano sim card and 4Gb micro SD card, and it works excellent, despite the specifications indicated for T-mobile it works in 3G not in 4G.Fast processing  and Android Kit Kat, allows to open multiple applications without slowing down. The screen size  (5\u201d) is perfect and the camera quality is high 6MP(16:9) and 8MP(4:3) and up to 4X zoom, you can take pictures and record videos with beautiful colors. I think this is the best phone for average person.The battery time, on low use, could last approximately 3 days and heavy use 1 day. It can take up to 1 hour to be fully charged.",

I'm rough on phones and having killed 2 iphone 4's with drops I didn't want to invest a ton of money in a phone.  I think this phone was a great compromise.  It was a little bigger than I expected, I have smallish hands so I was worried how it would be carrying it and using it (clearly, I'm not on trend with my dislike of large phones!).  I have grown to love the screen though and it's camera.  It was easy to set up.  The only annoyance early on was that it is set to vibrate as you type, and you have to turn it off in 3 different places to get it to stop.  Really that's a small complaint though.  Everything else was super easy.  If I kill this phone I would definitely buy another.",

As long as they are ok with decent 3G on the run and uses wifi most of the time for data I think this would be a good buy. I would have preferred them to offer the 16 GB variant at this price as the processor seems to be a bit slow for the price.The battery life is decent and would last a day with minimum calls (~3-4 hrs talktime) and games played quite frequently. The rear camera is a nice one for the price and seems to have served the purpose with which it was bought. I would give it around 3-3.5 stars but not 4 at this point of time. If after use I find it more useful and reasonable will further update this review.",

Motorola really has done a great job of creating a robust portfolio of some incredible phones.  The moto G might be considered one of their budget phones, but there really is nothing budget about it!  It has a premium design and feel to it, and as long as your are staring directly at the screen and not at an angle, you will have no qualms about the screen.  As for the responsiveness and UI of the phone, it feels like stock google with a few design tweeks here and there that do not feel cumbersome to stock android.  Overall, a great device to have around in case of a need for a back up phone arise.",

The new Moto E (2nd Gen) is getting a lot of attention right now but I think when the dust settles most folks will see that it's a tossup which of these two are better at their price points. You get a slightly better processor on the E along with 4G/LTE but you get a bigger screen and much better camera on the G (higher quality all around and it has a flash).I think people weigh the advantages of 4G/LTE far too heavily... I'm getting 11mbps down and 2mbps up on 3G right now (in a big metal building with spotty signal) and that is vastly more bandwidth than most folks need on a smartphone. There are still some folks that can't even get that speed in their homes (eek).",

This phone can hang with the best of them as far as its technical features and specs are concerned. I was impressed at how nice the graphics are and how fast the processor is. It has a good-sized internal memory also. My daughter never puts it down!  Motorola is not one of the biggest or most popular names in the smartphone industry, but they make phones that are just as good as some of those bigger name companies. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a higher-end phone but doesn't want to pay a higher-end price. The screen is not the biggest, but it is a decent size.",

In that price range, though, the Nexus 5 is still a fantastic, inexpensive unlocked phone with a 5-inch screen, although it lacks a memory card slot. All told, the G is a lot of phone for the low $179.99 asking price, and is certainly worthy of consideration.For LTE support you may want to check out:- Huawei Ascend Mate2 4G: http://amzn.to/1Np92BC- ZTE Nubia 5s: http://amzn.to/1Np93Fv- Nexus 5: http://amzn.to/1jee07s",

The dual speakers are a big improvement and the sound is great.  I like the size of the phone compared to my Samsung Fusion because it remains upright in my front pocket (Levi's).  My only complaint is battery life.  After being fully charged and turning off Bluetooth, GPS, Internet and with minimal phone calls and text messaging, I only have about 10 to 15% charge remaining at the end of the day.  I even set my screen brightness to about 50% to help conserve charge.  My Samsung could go for 5 days between charges under the same conditions.  Since the battery in the Moto G2 can't be changed, the phone may not last two years after so many recharging cycles.  Don't forget to take your charger with you, might even want to get a second one.  I did appreciate the battery charger being included in the box and not just a USB connector.",

I've tried sim cards from different operators but the result was the same. I use micro sim cards, inserting it according to instructions (contacts face to battery).Has anyone had similar issues with europe operators? Is there any solution? Or is it factory defect?Thanks in advance.",

It's best to get it from Amazon because going directly to Motorola is a mess.  While they do use FedEx for shipping Motorola misses their shipment time lines whereas Amazon is within a day or two of their shipment estimates  Note that if you want LTE the 2nd generation Moto G does not have it.  That's right the 1st generation did and Motorola decided to remove it so beware.  Also, it does not ship with Lollipop like Motorola claims.  It's Kit Kat OS.  Hoping they update their marketing to stop misleading customers. Hope this review is helpful.",

There are a very agressive task killer from motorola that shut down all the aplication on backgroud so they are yo be restarted when you reopen them. I hope this can be fixed soon with an update.All the aplication on play store run just fine on it. Including Asphalt 8. GPS, WiFi, Call sound quality, speaker quality, etc are flawless.",

Smooth operation, strong processor, plenty ram, gorgious screen, and plently storage for those apps.  I can now play my favorite game, Airplane Fly Hawaii, with full detail and it's glorious!  Battery life for my level of usage will be about two full days.Edit: 11/21/14 Front facing speakers should be the standard.  I love them and the phone. Way to go Motorola!  Everyone that looks at this phone thinks its an IPhone 6.  I put it next to an Iphone 6 in walmart and the only things that give it away is the Moto is slightly longer and has front firing speakers.  This is a cool phone!",

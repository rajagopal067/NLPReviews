All the reviews i read snd people i asked said this was the best budget smartphone, it isn't.  After about 3 weeks people complained about me sounding \"echoey\" and a lot of static. It only got worse, to the point where people could not hear me at all. It didn't matter whether or not i used WiFi calling or not or Bluetooth or not. I did all the recommended resets all to no avail.  I suspect a bad microphone.  It's a shame but this phone was a complete waste of money and i am unlikely to buy another Motorola phone. The sad part is that i only had it less than 3 months.",

It takes forever to view photos or to delete a photo.- getting in and out of countries or in and out of wifi networks has proven to be really difficult, or impossible.- the gps takes 10 min to update sometimes, that's really annoying when you are driving somewhere and need to choose a route. - downloading and installing applications is so slow i'd rather just ask my wife for her phone.the only good thing i could say is the camera works good, and the speaker works good.All and all, would not recommend it at all. I am sure for a $170 which is what i paid you can find great chinese phones. expected so much more from a motorola phone.",

First my battery will be at 90 percent and i turn the phone to sleep and i check it again 5 minutes  later and the battery is at 50 percent . i know this is not just my phone ive bought a new phone 3 times so each phone has only been about month old. Second problem the phone will be on lock i have a passcode on the phone. i will take it out of my pocket and the time will be in a diffrent format and the time zone is totally wrong this has happen with all three of the phones ive had. I dont recommend this phone to my worst nightmare .",

The guaranteed upgrade to Lollipop was pushed out a while ago, nicer screen, better battery life; that makes it even cooler!Flawless with AT&T, I don't care that it's not full 4G LTE, it does everything I need it to, even watching Xfinity Go on data works fine.One complaint, and this has nothing to do with the phone: Zagg still hasn't released a screen protector for it. Really disappointed in Zagg for that. This is the first phone out of 5 or so in our family that doesn't have a Zagg.",

It feels like using a tablet to call and I have to use a hands free set as an option (even when they don't came in the box) another minus is the absence of USB cable for charging because I work all day on a computer and we have few plugs in the office. Sometimes the screen freeze when it comes to rotate the image. Maybe I was expecting too much from Motorola but is not quite a deception. You certainly get what you paid for, but my personal recommendation is Huawei P6. Lighter, faster, friendlier and comes with all the accesories.",

This phone probably has the best screen or on par with my work Iphone5. It is likely has the best performance and is the most high tech. The build quality is great too. Size wise, it's near perfect too. I do really like this phone, but I don't \"Love It\" - it lacks some panache or special feature that really makes it stand out. By the way, I opted for the 2nd Gen 4G instead of the 1st gen 4G LTE and I am glad I did. The better screen and camera are worth it. 4G is great and not that slower than the LTE in my area.",

The internet connection is fast enough for mostly anything you want to do, even if it doesn't have LTE. The screen is perfect, battery is great, and update support is GREATLY appreciated. This phone has already been upgraded to Android Lollipop which is rare for a phone in this price range for an update to roll out so quick. I like that this phone uses an almost stock version of Android without any tacky skin on it or bloatware apps. The fact the the memory is expandable is a great thing too. Motorola really hit the nail on the head with this phone.",

You wont be disappointed at all!Though i love the phone... just thought I'd mention two IMPORTANT things which I wish it had but it doesnt:1. Comes with only phone and plain charger. No facility for data cable...no slot provided either. A workaround for this would be to remove ur SD card and use it with another card reader to move data.2. You also don't have any slot to plug in a pair of earphones to listen to music n stuff..a workaround for this would be to use a bluetooth enabled headset...meaning go wireless :)Nevertheless, Id still rate it 5 for its super voice quality and battery life!!! Apart from an 8mp Cam, latest android version n stuff!Highly recommend this super duper phone...best cost effective phone with amazing specs!!!!",

Had to send that back because of charging issues and the poor GPS performance (wandered all over the place!). This Moto G is great, the GPS locks on quickly and even gives accurate readings under fairly heavy tree cover. My GARMIN Oregon doesn't work this well (no GLONASS). And having a \"pure\" Android system is really nice. I don't have to hack the phone to get off all of the junk that you get from a phone supplied by the cellular provider.",

We were very impressed with the camera quality, and the expandable memory is great. We also loved that increase in screen size from the moto g (which I own).

Hence, i was eager to make a yet another Motorola purchase. I was not tempted to buy the 1st gen mainly due to the lack of SD slot.But the 2nd Gen is a great product and highly recommend.

I tried to get Motorola support to help me with fixing this but they kept walking me through the same non-sense 3 different times with same result.  When you call them you get support out of Phillipines which is fine, however they don't track case numbers and their computers always seem to be \"running slow\" or are \"down\".  Disappointed with the product but even more disappointed with the service.  Save your money do not buy this crap.",

More or less stock Android is another bonus.The build quality is excellent -  even though it is made of plastic it feels solid. The screen has very nice viewing angles and good colors. The only downsides are the 8GB of storage and lack of LTE but in my case HSPA+ is fast enough and an SD card makes up for the lack of storage.",

I had lost my job in October and my Samsung Galaxy died that week too, so I was without a smart phone for a couple months. I was worried about spending less because I've always bought the biggest and best. I do not regret getting this phone one bit. Admittedly I do have to keep my apps to a minimum because it is only 8G of internal which every app has to be at least partially installed on but I'm totally comfortable with that.",

Even though this doesn't come with 4g LTE, it still does HSPA+ and I can get ~7Mbps where I live, which is plenty for web searching and streaming HD videos. Glad I didn't spend $500+ on a phone, when this thing does everything I want for $180. Can't wait for the Android 5.0 Lollipop upgrade!",

Want to have google maps navigation and listen to music? One of them is going to force close. How about talk on facebook messenger while browsing the web? One of them's going to force close. As a bonus, sometimes apps take up to 30 seconds to launch, and the keyboard will stutter for a long time. The phone has been like this since September and Motorola has not fixed it yet. Don't buy a crappy product until they fix it.",

The OS (Android 5.0 Lollipop) is a complete disaster, the apps keep closing on their own and lag. The phone charger stopped working after 2 months, and I've hated using this phone almost after the second week of use when it started crashing. I have factory resetted it, formatted it and nothing has worked. So don't think it's a virus or anything like that, this phone is actually factory hardware damaged. If you want a good phone that will never let you down, get yourself and iPhone. I had and iPhone 4S myself but I got robbed, so I've bought two android phones since then. A cheap $80 ZTE V790 which turned out to be absolutely a piece of crap and this one which wasn't significantly better if you consider the price. So I now swear I will never pay for another android phone in my life again, better save a whole year for an iPhone that waste my money again on an Android phone. And just for the record, the worst part was still Lollipop.",

            "comment": "I am very disappointed with this phone.Was looking forward for this phone. few days after I started using it I noticed that The phone becomes slow after about a day of use. many apps becoming slow and crash. Facebook , What-sup, Messages+ e.t.c . In order to make it work I need to reboot the phone.Some times it will reboot by itself.Sounds ridiculous to me to reboot it every day. I have never experienced these kind of issues with my previous Samsung S3.Update 11/06/2014:I returned the phone and ordered a replacement . The was some improvement in performance and better battery life , but instead of rebooting the phone every day now I should do it every 2 days. Some times even I am not able to make a call before the restart .I uninstalled Facebook app, then Swift Key keyboard, whatsup, Messages+. Nothing helped. I was really confused by where all these 5 stars reviews come from.How can it happen only to me on both phones? And finally i found a thread on motorola owners forum with people having same issues[...]Is it too much to ask for from the \"best budget\" phone to work stable? Nobody else who purchased this phon on Amazon has similar issues?Returning the second one too. Really upset and disappointed.",

Build quality is excellent, and I keep it in a case since new, no screen protectors though.It lasts 1.5 days on me easily- so the battery is very good indeed.Lack of a card slot is not a problem, since I charge it form my laptop while in office, so transferring all extra files to PC is easy- and that's before the clous storage.It is a little low on RAM- with the amount of sw I installed it is 72-79% taken, so I have to use dedicated apps to close all the apps in the background all the time.Camera is worse than my other phone (Nokia N86), but still ok for the price.Overall, a very good deal, compared to the iphones my colleagues are using.In fact, I ordered the new version of the G, and this one is going to my son.",

BUT THE \"4G\" HSPA+ GETS THE JOB DONE.  Well first off I am not sure how others here are getting such great battery life.. This is actually one of the top letdowns on this sequel, And I know how to manage a devices battery. It drains very quickly!  Also be forewarned upfront that if you are getting it because of the front speakers you will also be disappointed.  Compared to the original these pump out less decibel volume! I actually had to use an equalizer app from the play store to make it better & always have to fiddle with it. I am not sure if Motorola thought that by moving the speakers to the front that they should lower the actual volume. But it was a poor move,  Both the first Moto G & the Moto X are noticeably louder. Also while HSPA+ \"4G\" yes is useable when off of wifi. I have noticed on several speedtests (I am on Tmobile at the moment) that its just not very fast sometimes only around 1-2mbps. It is just not as zippy in general as the original. So in closing I am sadly returning this. It is a shame too as I liked the larger screen. I would say thats the only thing they improved on with this. Oh & yes the camera is better! but not a whole lot. I actually like the way shots looked with the flash in lower light on the first G better. With this one the coloring is a bit to bright looking sometimes even when you dial back the exposure.  Again having to use an app to do that.",

It is 2nd generation so it has the stereo speakers on the front and more importantly it has an SD slot. I have to admit that it is heavier than I thought it would be. Heavy is not necessarily bad, it feels solid and I don't notice the weight so much when it's in my pocket. Reading the specifications is one thing but actually having it in my hand is the real test. It is also quite large which I don't dislike but once again I was a little surprised. The phone is about the size of the new Apple iPhone 6. The curved back that people say gives it a good feel is not noticeable, at least to me. Perhaps for people with smaller hands it is. I find the back of the phone does not really touch the palm of my hand. It's like holding an iPhone 6 (I've held other people's phones).I couldn't wait to try it out and this is where I have some concerns. Intuition does not seem to have played a part in the design of the graphical user interface. The camera set up is strange and the messages management seems strange. Also, when you want to make a phone call (It's a phone - right?), even though you have contacts set up (not a great experience) it does not display them. It only displays people you have recently called. You have to select an \"All Contacts\" button to see your directory. Adding a phone number to a contact was not easy the first time and I'm not sure I remember how it's done. Why doesn't a phone display the dial pad right away when you press the phone icon with maybe a contact button as well, there's plenty of room on the screen. When you have to use the manual to figure out how to use anything, it's not a good sign.Perhaps it's a sign I'm getting old but when the phone rang I pressed the white picture of a phone - no go, I couldn't answer the call. Call this intuitive? Read the manual and you have to swipe to the right to accept the call, swipe to the left to decline. I missed about three calls before I read the manual and I'm not ashamed to say that. I don't want to read the user manual to figure out how to make and receive calls on a phone. Also, you do not tap the name of the person you want to dial, you need to tap their number. I've worked with many GUIs and this is not very intuitive. Back to Steve Jobs methinks and just pay the price for a great design.I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me. We are using the unlocked phones on a service provider with no contract and a $20/month plan for my wife and I that covers some data and a good amount of voice and messaging. I will not pay $120/month for a phone service even if it is cellular. We do use cellular on our iPads so that helps with data because it's cheap and the carriers are reliable and provide excellent coverage.So the jury is out and we're both not as excited as we were. My wife had a terrible time getting out of a Google set up loop. It felt to us like the phone was a \"used' phone given that it said she had a previous account and behaved differently to mine. The Google terms and conditions were about 17 pages long and written in legalese. There are about three different agreements, all long winded and a good cure for insomnia. I have not consented yet, I need to know what Google is trying to lock me into. That;s another story.It was tricky getting the back off, it's not as easy as the user guide makes it seem and you feel like it's going to break the first time you try. I installed a new micro-SIM and a 32GB SD card in both phones.I took a couple of photos and with a hand held camera, optical mage stabilization would be a good idea but the photos are not bad in good light. This is not critical for me given I have an iPad that I carry around constantly. Same with browsing and email.Google Now is interesting. Click on the Google icon and say \"OK Google\" and you can speak a search string like \"How far is it from the earth to the sun?\". Bingo, you get your answer - what a great app. Siri does the same thing of course and I don't know how they compare. The FM radio works well. I used my own headphones - no problem! Quickoffice looks interesting and offers a form of word, excel and powerpoint. I haven't really tried downloading apps yet and I suspect I need to get through the various Google terms and conditions before I can.I think the price point for this phone is great. Just under $200 for the phone compared to over $600 for an iPhone if you want an unlocked iPhone. Locking into a contract for over $120/month for phone service is not going to happen in our house.We will persevere for a couple of weeks or so to see if we can get used to the new interface and find our way around a little easier. If it doesn't work out, well, there are cheaper options out there for smart phones and phone service.",

I turned it off to get a restart and now it does not respond to any key press. It had 60% battery so it shouldn't be it (I also plugged it in and still no response). I even tried pressing the volume down and power keys for two minutes and nothing. I am so disappointed with it. I can not send it back because I have it in Argentina now and the shipping only would amount to almost as much as it cost.This is my first and last experience with a motorola phone and it has clearly been awful. I would never ever buy or recommend another motorola product for the rest of my life.Hopefully I have not lost all my data since I still have my old Samsung S Advance phone which worked reliably for almost two years.Motorola sucks, don't buy this phone unless you wanna gamble on yours working properly. If not, you are risking losing all the data you have on your phone.I would give it 0 stars but I cannot.",

            "comment": "I bought this phone a little over a month ago, I wanted to wait and see how it did rather than writing a review like \"oh it came out of the box and it's so shiny! I love it!\" Well at first it was nice, the only problem I had was how big it was coming from an iPhone 4s to this was a huge difference. I still don't like the size, its hard for me to text. The phone worked well for about 3 weeks and now it's not doing so great.1. The charger it came with is lose and I have to set it just right for it to charge, if you bump it it moves and I wake up with a dead phone sometimes.2.For some reason when I go certain places the internet completely stops working, the wifi and the 3g and also in these places the bluetooth won't work. So if you have a tablet I guess you could bring that in case you need to get online for some reason.3. The memory is very low, obviously. But one day the phone wouldn't let me do anything because it kept saying there was no memory. I deleted a couple pictures and then it worked fine.4. I have a constant notification that my messages are not being sent, although I believe that they are since I have tested it with people sitting next to me. At first it was one, then two, and now it always says 8 messages couldn't be sent. When I click on this notification it just brings me to my messages and doesn't show me any messages that haven't been sent.5. Sometimes while I am looking at my phone I see messages appear at the top and then when I go to my messages to open the new message it is no where to be found. I guess I am just lucky when I see the ones I do that way I can text the person and ask them what their message said.Of course I am passed the date to return the phone when all this stuff started happening so, maybe I'll give it to my daughter to play on. It's not a HORRIBLE phone... but it isn't reliable. I think I'll go back to my iPhone.",

Happy with the purchase.",

I'm surprised how good the integration is with T-Mobile, the voice mail, texting, gmail and exchange-email all seem to be working very well. Plus they have promised a Lollipop upgrade asap without having to worry about my carrier.Bluetooth integration works well. I use a Roadster 2 in my car and a Logitech HT800 at work the integration is great. Plus with the Google now (Okay Google) and MotoSpeak app for hands free driving. The launcher seems to make the calls hand free most times with only occasionally having to repeat the command. It very nice to just ask it to play a song or artist and it just does it.I'm using the US GSM version and with T-Mobile, I'm seeing LTE like speed with HSPA+. I've seen youtube videos saying you may get more bandwidth on T-Mobile with HSPA+ than an overloaded AT&T LTE network.  Music streaming and app downloading has been great no delays. 20Mb apps from the play store seem to be downloading over HSPA+ in about 30 seconds.The MicroSD slot was great. I took the 32GB card out of my old phone and put it directly into the new phone. It carried over all the photo's, music, audible books, podcasts etc.Even though the body is plastic it has a nice shape that feels good in the hand. Once you put the phone in a case that plastic body becomes a non-issue. We ended up buying four Moto-G unlocked here and we are all really happy.",

People are complaining about the drop in pixel density, it is ONLY noticeable on paper: the display will simply blow your mind. The battery life is still AMAZING. The stock Android experience is everything you ever wished for: fast, clean, simple and intuitive. I reviewed the original Moto G only after 6 months of ownership to give an opinion as honest as possible and everything I said about the 1st Gen still applies here (check it out under my reviews). Amazing phone and one investment you won't regret.",

            "comment": "The 2014 Moto G is a really great phone. My primary phone has been a Moto X for the past 10 months or so. I love the phone, but wanted a slightly bigger screen. I've been testing others - the Nexus 5, the LG G2... I have been tempted by the G2 but don't like some of the LG tweaks that you can't get rid of without going with a full custom ROM. The Nexus 5 is good, but I just didn't get into it.So when Moto announced the new G, I thought I'd give it a shot. I had played with a 2013 Moto G and liked it, but it didn't blow me away, especially compared to the Moto X. The lack of LTE doesn't bother me, as AT&T generally has excellent HSPA coverage in the US, and I don't do anything that requires LTE speeds. I ordered the global model in part in the hope that it would be dual SIM - alas, I can confirm that the global model marketed here is NOT dual SIM. Regardless, I am very, very impressed with the handset - the screen is excellent particularly for the price. In my opinion, the lower resolution is not noticeable even when next to a Nexus 5, which has the same size screen but with a 1920x1080 resolution. The Nexus and the G feel about the same in build quality. I'll have to put it through its paces to see what it can really do, but I don't know of a comparable handset for $179 with no contract. The real winner for me is the microSD card slot. I am so happy to have expandable storage.Strangely enough, I feel like the device is an upgrade from the Moto X, despite the slower processor and lack of LTE.If you want a device that costs very little, has excellent build quality, an awesome screen, a nearly stock Android experience (with a few minor Moto improvements), expandable storage, and generally speedy performance... look no further. This is the one. I'll be playing with this phone for a while, at least until I can get my hands on a 2014 Moto X for cheap!",

There is virtually nothing you can't do in this phone, that you can on an i6.  The screen is HD easy to read, acceptable cameras and most apps you actually \"need\".  Plays apps such as minecraft, candy crush, heads up, clumsy ninja, angry birds racing, Gmail, youtube, HBOGO, chromecast, Google Maps, Xfinity....EVERYTHING.  Dual cameras, bluetooth, wifi, everything you actually need in a phone.  You can even run FLASH with the dolphin browser, no jailbreak needed. If you need to edit video or large documents, use a Desktop Computer! Although there are many apps in android and ios for editing, nothing beats a real desktop computer for the job.Picture taking is acceptable for everyday/casual use, many apps for this as well.  Has a LED flash, which can also be used as flashlight/strobe light with the right app.With an app, you can BROWSE and manipulate files as you would on a desktop PC.  Significantly less expensive than other android phones as well.If you feel it platicky (yes, the back IS plastic), just get a decent case.  After all, everybody I know ends up putting a silicon/plastic case on their phones anyway.Paired with chip from Consumer Cellular (AT&T mvno), I have a great solution for my teen, who doesn't care much about communication features as much as games - we pay $35 a month for TWO lines.  Limited minutes and data, but since we spend most of our time in wifi, we don't really need it.These phones are so inexpensive you don't feel you are going to loose a fortune if misplaced or lost.If you need a better camera, I wouldn't buy a phone (not even an i6), but rather a real camera.  With the price of this phone, you can even have money left for a full DSLR to take professional quality pictures/movies.With the play-store, and many other services around, this is even a good alternative to the itouches - with the added benefit of being able to make real calls when necessary.",

This phone is pretty close to the Nexus 5, but you can see the compromises. First off, the screen is not as sharp as the higher resolution phones. But it is not a grainy screen, like you get in the least expensive phones. I was surprised, and I'd definitely rate it \"good enough\".Some similar phones try to get by with 4 GB of memory. I don't think that is enough, even with SD card storage. The SD card slot basically gives this phone more storage than the Nexus 5 32GB version. The 1 GB of ram shows up if you try to do two intensive things at once with this phone. It will have trouble, which means it will dump the app you are not using right at that moment. So, it's not perfect.The camera is close to the one in the Nexus 5, but the N5 is not considered to have a great camera. The Moto G feels smaller, and the body is very easy for me to hold. The speakers sound pretty good, a bit better than the Nexus 5. The GPS in the Moto works quite a bit better.It's not an LTE phone but most buyers will be on data plans with limited data, I assume. The 3G is fast enough to do most things, and you can't sit and browse for hours with a low end data plan.Right now you can buy a Nexus 6 or an iPhone Plus, but it's going to be around $800 with the sales tax. Those are the top of the line phones, like the Note 4. If you want it and don't mind the price, go for it. These are luxury phones, basically. To scale back a little, the Nexus 5 is still around, but that is around $400 with 32 GB. This phone is half that, though you need an SD card. The Nexus 5 has better hardware, no question, but we're getting to where most of the decent smartphone processors do a good job for everything but gaming, or multiple apps.There are at least 4 tiers these days. You've got the most basic stuff Walmart sells for Straight Talk, the $100 or less Android. Then you have this phone, in tier 2, with some of the BLU stuff, some Basic Samsung phones. The third tier is probably last years quality phones, like the Nexus 5 or the Galaxy S4, maybe an older iPhone or a refurb. And then the top tier is the iPhone 6 or Nexus 6. I think this is a great phone for the price, and compares well with the next tier up. If you want the top, it's a LOT more money.",

Gives him just about everything you'll need out of an Android and he likes the operating system-easy to use.  I didn't want to spend tons of money, but also wanted him to have a quality phone. This was the perfect gift.",

Excellent pics in bright light although in dim light not as good as iPhone. But at 1/3 the price of an iPhone, I can't complain. Definitely great quality for a reasonable price.",

I have to forward all my third party emails to my Google account in order for the phone to keep them for reference. That is why I will go four stars.",

For me this replaced a Moto G 1st generation and this is a step up from that.  Since this phone is not tied to a carrier, updates come much sooner.  I got Lollipop in 12/14.",

I do not use cell phones so I cannot detail all the qualities he loves.  Sorry and he is not up for reviewing anything.  He has had it for only a short time so can't do any better than this.",

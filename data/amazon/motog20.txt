            "comment": "I wanted to provide a quick review for the Moto G 2nd Gen. Specific model is the US GSM Black 8gb. I purchased this for my wife here on Amazon. We use AT&T and I wanted to replace my wife's aging iPhone4 off contract. This is the best phone for the price I found. I charged the phone, inserted her AT&T sim card from her iphone4, inserted the 16gb micro sd card (can use up to 32gb), and everything worked flawlessly.Pros: lovely 5\" screen, quick and responsive touch, perfect size screen, Gorilla Glass! micro-usb charging (common), stock Android Kit Kat, upgradeable to Android L when released, MicroSD card slot, front stereo speakers, great call quality, great reception, price, unlocked (great for travel), no contract! Blutooth and Wifi work fine. No issues connecting to our home network and my wifes work wifi.Cons: No 4GLTE, Non Removable battery, No included headset/ear buds, LIMITED accessories so far(cases)Build Quality: Nothing to complain about. Perfect weight, feels solid, very tight, does NOT feel flimsy. The back phone cover is easily swappable. The black color is a deep matte black. Not slippery hard plastic, but a more rubberized feel.Battery life is very good. Not stellar, but easily lasts a complete day for my wife who is a average smartphone user. I just wish the battery was replaceable to increase longevity of the phone.This phone is perfect for the non-power user, average user, someone new to android, or is replacing their phone off contract. The specs are slightly above average for a phone in this price category! It is an amazing phone for under $200 off contract. 4G LTE would have been greatly appreciated, but it is not necessary because my wife's iphone 4 never had it either (and she is almost always connected to wifi anyways).I personally use the flagship LG G3 on AT&T (another AMAZING phone). so I set everything up for my wife (iphone4 user). I imported her contacts from her iphone which was simple after watching a few youtube videos on how to do it. Just search on youtube \"iPhone to Android Contact list\". The entire process after watching the video took 2 minutes lol. Of course this phone cannot compare to my LG G3, BUT, I was very impressed with this MotoG 2nd Gen.Contents: Box, Manuals, phone, and charging cable with plug. It is a wall plug with long microusb cable attached to the plug itself. Basically the wall plug adapter and the microusb cable cannot be separated. It is built as one single unit.NOTE* If you live in the UNITED STATES, buy the US GSM version. The Global version will work fine.... BUT the US GSM version is better suited for US cellular signals. I can confirm this phone works perfectly with AT&T and should work perfectly with T-mobile.I would order this phone again in a heartbeat for my wife. She loves it. I hope this review helps!****Minor Update****This phone continues to impress me. The screen is very bright and the colors are vivid and punchy. The screen resolution is more than adequate, it is very similar to the iphone 4 retina display. If you look closely, you can barely see pixels. Don't worry, the screen is very sharp and small text can be read with ease.After playing with the phone for over 12 hours, installing apps, configuring the phone, browsing the web, facebook, spotify, etc.. I still show 30% battery remaining from a full charge this morning! This was an intensive day of usage setting everything up. I easily downloaded 20+ apps, and probably 100 songs on spotify.,Do not be concerned about the lack of \"dual sim\". Unless you are a frequent traveler going overseas this is not an important feature. Dual sim is used so that when traveling, you can buy a foreign sim card and insert it into your phone without needing to remove your primary sim card (hence, dual sim). With this single sim US GSM model, just remove your sim and swap it out for the foreign sim card, no big deal. Just don't lose your primary sim card lol.*********************",

            "comment": "Edit 9/18/14: fixed error about SIM cards and wifi specsAlso, here is a useful link to information about SD card usage in android: https://forums.motorola.com/posts/7e59cc7bafEdit 9/21/14: Yesterday I used my phone indoors with standard usage. The screen brightness was manually set between around 20-40% the entire day. When I plugged in the phone when going to bed, I had 14h and 45 min of battery time, and 5 hours of screen on time. I still had 20% battery left. The battery is as awesome as before!(Note: Because this global version is the same as the US version, and only differs by having different 3G bands, I've copied my review from the US version.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Moto G was a huge hit for Motorola in 2013, as it provided many people with a fast, new smartphone at an extremely affordable price. Now in 2014, Motorola has updated the Moto G with its second iteration. There are many similarities with the first generation, and a few important changes/improvements.Similarities:-Same screen resolution, 1280x720-Same CPU, Snapdragon 400 (1.2ghz quad core)-Same, 3G only connectivity (no LTE in this model)-Same 2070mah batteryImprovements/Changes:-Screen size changed from 4.5\" to 5\"-Front camera upgraded from 1.3MP to 2MP-Rear camera upgraded from 5MP to 8MP-Speaker upgraded from mono rear speaker to front stereo speakers-MicroSD card slotDisadvantages compared to first generation:-Some dislike the bigger screen-Slightly worse battery life due to bigger screen size with same battery size-Pixel density dropped from 326ppi to 294ppiWhile this second generation Moto G has slightly worse battery life and pixel density than the first generation, these are minute differences that will most likely go unnoticed. What does matter, though, is that the second generation Moto G builds on the successes of the first Moto G, and adds multiple improvements to make this a truly excellent low budget phone. My main complaints about the first gen Moto G focused on the poor camera performance and lack of SD card slot. Now, this and more has been improved with the second generation. Rather than an revolution, this is an evolution of the previous Moto G, making it better than ever.The first thing you notice when picking up the second generation Moto G is that it's bigger. I'll admit it, it's harder to hold this phone with one hand when compared to the first generation. However, the big beautiful screen makes up for it. While I no longer own the first gen for side to side comparison, the screen feels like it's brighter and more color accurate. The front facing speakers are a huge plus if you watch videos or your phone, as you no longer have to cup your hand around the back of the phone to \"reflect\" the sound towards your face. Probably as a result of them facing you all the time, the speakers also seem to be louder. This also brings around an advantage if you use the speakers to play music, since you no longer have to put the phone face down for the sound to remain unmuffled.The cameras are also a HUGE improvement. As a a college student, I use the front camera quite a lot to communicate with friends. The previous front facing camera (FFC) was very splotchy and muddy. The new FFC honestly feels like it's better than the rear facing camera on the first gen. Although I didn't use the rear camera on the first gen very often, the one in this phone seems to have better color reproduction and dynamic range. To put the camera upgrade into perspective, it's roughly like going from an iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5.All these improvements are available for the same MSRP ($179.99) as before, which is an excellent deal; especially considering the fact that the phone now has a Micro SD card slot, the 8GB onboard memory poses less of an issue. I will keep this review updated if I face anything that changes my opinion of this phone; but for now, it deserves a 5/5.",

            "comment": "Wonderful phone. Switched from a Nexus 4 to this because I was fed up with poor battery life. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. Its vivid and bright and puts my nexus 4 screen to shame. The phone has a premium feel with a nice weight and soft touch back. Certainly doesn't feel like a sub $200 phone and in my opinion feels better than some plasticy flagship phones. Battery life so far has been excellent easily lasting a full day with average usage and screen set to 75% brightness. The performance is snappy with no noticeable lag whatsoever. Front speakers are nice upgrade- youtube videos and calls on speaker sound crisp and clear. I threw in an micro SD and transferred pictures, videos, and music to it quickly in the storage settings. I am not sure how installing apps to the SD card will work but I am not sure I will need to do that if I keep all my media on the SD card.The only hesitation I had about buying this phone was lack of LTE. HSPA+ speeds on Tmobile have been around 5 Mbs down which is more than adequate for browsing mobile sites, youtube videos, streaming music, and navigation. I am able to do all of these things without noticeable delay so I personally don't mind the lack of LTE. I contemplated this model vs the 2013 Moto G with LTE and decided to go with this for the larger display and better camera.In all, if you are on a cell phone plan that does not offer phone subsidy or use a prepaid service, this really is an incredible value. It does not feel like a cheap phone. Sure there are some deficiencies like lack of LTE and 1 GB of ram, but if those things aren't crucial to you, then there is little to differentiate this $180 phone from phones that are priced over $600 in terms of user experience.",

            "comment": "Quick review: This is the best value phone there is, and more!Disclosure: I am upgrading from Samsung S4...yes, you heard it right!Pros:1. 180$ unlocked. I mean you can't get better than that for these specs.2. Surprisingly has gyroscope...So, all those VR games work fine. And work well. First Gen did not have that.3. Its not as low end as you might think. Powered by 1.2Ghz quad core, 1GB RAM (which is more than sufficient for most applications) and decent graphics, its no slouch! Everything is super fluid so far. In fact, I am surprised how fluid this device is. Samsung S4 got slouchy because of the buttload of Samsung applications running in the background.4. 5\" 720p screen is awesome! There was a time when Apple sold 540p screen and advertised it as retina display and everybody went gaga. Well, even at 5\" 720p, this is still a retina display, with close to 300ppi. So, people clamouring for 1080p screen on Moto G, shut up...:-)5. Battery life. What can I say! This was a surprise for me. Excellent standby time and great daytime use time. I slept with battery at 81% and woke up with 80%, that's 1% consumed in 8+ hours. During the day, for my normal use, it drains at around 1-3% per hour as per \"better battery stats\" program. It stays in deep sleep most of the times. I use Assist's \"Battery Saver\" feature and have wifi ON all the time. Bluetooth and GPS are off, most of the time.6. Digging the sound coming out of front speakers. So much better than my crappy Samsung S4's rear speaker!7. GPS locks in less than 2 seconds. So much better than Samsung S4, where I had to wait for 5 mins sometimes.8. Works with MicroSD cards of 64GB size. It was advertised as only upto 32GB but it works fine if you format with vfat before hand in your PC or Linux OS (my preference: command is mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/sdi, assuming /dev/sdi is the card).9. Kitkat 4.4.4 and the ability to unlock bootloader (good for folks who don't care about warranty!) without jumping through hoops. Pure android experience!10. Ability to move apps to SD card, unless an app specifically insist on not being allowed to move.Cons:1. Cheap ass buttons. What Motorola! They are really cheap. Put in better power and volume buttons in Gen3. Please...:-)2. Heavy. Coming from S4, this was heavier but it feels solid in my hands and there is no chance of this slipping out of my hands like S4 because its not as slippery as S4 in the back. I don't mind the weight but some people might.3. Non-removable battery. This is not execusable. Since the cover is removable, the battery should be too. If it was one piece like Apple iPhone, I would grant this but its not. Anyway, this is minor. I can carry a spare charger for it. And longterm, I hope, the battery keeps working until I am ready to upgrade again.Update 1 (Oct 3, 2014): Some folks have asked how much internal storage we have left after we install typical apps: I have about 3.4GB left after about 35 apps I use. I don't have big time games (apart from Angry birds) but typical apps like whatsapp, firefox, outlook, yahoo, banking apps, skype, sudoku, tetris, vlc, vim, netflix and many others I don't recall etc. This includes about 200MB of history I imported from my old phone for whatsapp. I think 5.5GB of space is plenty for a typical install and there is no need to worry. Moreover, this phone DOES allow to move apps (some apps may block this operation) to SD card. So, you can free up space if you need to down the road. Its a non-issue IMHO!Update 2 (Oct 4, 2014): Having used the phone for a week now, this phone continues to impress me. Quick update of charging time: I started at around 43% and it charged to 86% in under 2 hours. Using a cable directly attached to the USB port on motherboard *and NOT* to a USB hub. Or else, use the supplied wall charger.",

            "comment": "I purchased a white Motorola G 2nd generation to replace my 1st generation Moto G. My main motivation to buy was the improved camera in the 2nd gen over the 1st generation. The bigger screen was a nice side effect. I got used to the screen size quickly. I am disappointment about the quality of the photos though. The pictures can be quite grainy still. If your sole motivation is the improved camera, I don't recommend the upgrade from Moto G to the 2nd gen.A week ago I started having problems with the headphone jack and wasn't able to fully insert the headphone jack and thus unable to make phone calls over my headset. I called in Motorola Customer Care and described the problem. They were quick to say that they can send out a replacement unit since this kind of malfunction cannot be fixed remotely. But, first they had to verify I bought this phone in the US. I was surprised by that request but nonetheless submitted my receipt showing delivery to my place in California. Little did I know. It took me another 3 attempts to resolve this issue over the phone. Every time I called and explained my situation I was put on hold for extended periods of time while the representative was talking to another department. In the end, I even submitted a photo of the box the phone came in including the packaging slip. The last rep I contacted said that my case has been escalated as High Priority in the Department today. That was exactly three days ago and I have yet to hear back from Motorola Customer Service. From a service point of view Motorola gets zero Stars. The phone is ok but since I am not able to use it without the headphone it gets only one star.",

            "comment": "I'm typically not one for buying brand new products, as I like to avoid buying things that are not well-established yet, but I'm glad I decided to pre-order this. To avoid having this sound too much like a sales pitch, I'm just going to say what comes to mind in whatever order it comes to mind...The screen is a good size and is very easy to read. There is a lot of detail for such a small screen, and I was very happy with how it all looked.The phone feels solid in your hand without feeling too bulky. It IS admittedly a pretty sizable phone, so I wouldn't suggest getting this for someone who has tiny hands, but for someone with average size hands or bigger, it feels nice to hold and is easy to use.The touch screen is responsive and accurate. I haven't done much in the way of multi-touch for testing, but the little bit I've encountered has gone just fine, so I expect that it all works pretty well.Having the mSD slot was a fantastic addition over the original Moto G, and frankly, if you get something like a 32GB mSD card, you're never going to feel like you're running out of space.When I first got the phone, I wasn't sure how the camera quality was going to be as I was upgrading from a phone with a 3.2 MP camera, so I didn't think 8MP was going to be a humongous improvement... that was when I realized how much of an effect the phone itself has on how good the pictures it takes are. My old phone was sluggish at the best of times, so even the 2MP front camera on the Moto G takes fantastic pictures by comparison. The 8MP camera on the back focuses well and takes great pictures for the typical person. If you really want high-quality pictures, perhaps you should consider a proper camera, but for a phone, this does a great job.I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speakers. Typically speaking I'd be using headphones for music, but I did check out the stereo speakers for the sake of testing, and they had a much nicer sound than I expected them to have. There's not much bass to speak of, but the rest of the sound spectrum sounds quite nice coming out of the phone, even at higher volumes and with noisier music.Lastly, the connectivity of the phone is pretty solid. It's not 4G, but it does get the higher 3G speeds (HSPA+, etc), and data usage has always felt quite snappy when you're in an area with decent coverage. I use mine with Straight Talk (AT&T service through them), and I'm very happy with it.My only minor qualm with the phone is the battery. If you watch how you use the phone, the battery lasts quite a while and is more than sufficient. However, if you aren't too careful with your usage of the internet and such on the phone, you can drain the battery more quickly than I would like. Still, though - phones weren't designed to be used too extensively, so as long as you're using it sensibly, it's still plenty of battery life.",

            "comment": "Already many people gave reviews about the specs and technical stuff of this smartphone so I will just limit my review to my first impressions.First, I bought this phone on the Cyber Monday sale here on Amazon at $149, the regular price at the moment was $179 so it was a good deal. The reason I bought it was mainly because my old phone, a Motorola Razr HD was literally dying (the battery was bloated to the point it slowly broke the phone). Amazon delivered this phone 3 days before expected by UPS, so that's a plus.The good part: If you have doubts about this phone forget about it. It looks and feels like a high end expensive one. In addition,  was impressed with how it guided me and helped me to migrate all my old phone stuff (photos, videos, music, apps) smoothly with the Motorola migrate app. I felt I didn\u2019t have to do a thing! I also was impressed with the speakers (the sound is fantastic compared with other phones) and the battery life, that last way more than other phones I used before.The bad part: When I received the package, the box was almost open, like someone wanted to peek inside, but when I finally opened it, everything I bought was there: the  Moto G 2nd gen and a case. When I took the phone out of the box I noticed right away it had a very small dent  in the right side along the border. I looked closely every bit of the phone and have to say that it slightly felt like somebody used this phone already. I couldn't tell for sure. Also, the charger didn\u2019t fit the phone. I tried to connect the charger to the phone and had to stop because I seriously thought I was going to damage the phone if I continued. I'm using another Motorola charger instead. Beside these issues, the phone look good and these are the only bad thing I can say about this phone. I still recommend it.What I'm looking forward: I cant wait for the Lollipop software update as I have seen videos of the improvements. I also wish that this phone doesn't have the same issue as my old Motorola HD (battery bloating). I really don't like that you cant take the battery out.I'm still exploring my new phone. I wrote this review only 24 hours after getting it, so I will give an updated review of my experience with it later.",

I then held down the power button till the notification LED came on about 20 seconds later and then the screen lit up only to show 0% battery. This made no sense because my phone was fully charged when I was using it. And the phone was in no way pressed for resources. I'll let it charge I thought...but what I observed next was: The notification LED lit up again and went off. The screen lit up again only to show 0% charge and then went off. This cycle kept on repeating itself for about 3 hours till I'd had enough.I am disappointed and surprised. Never expected this from a Motorola product.",

So I went with this phone. For what it costs, it is a great phone. Coming from an S4, you could tell the difference in speed and processing, as this phone is a bit slower but it isn't a big deal. It moves smoothly and I just make sure not to run crazy amount of apps. I've always done that anyways. Unfortunately, not LTE, but here in the West side of Miami, get decent speeds with T Mobile. Yesterday I actually clocked 9.7 Mbps download speeds at the FIU campus. Not bad at all. Sure, it isn't the 20 plus I would get with LTE but I never needed that much speed anyways. For my social media, browsing, videos, texting, it is all I need, I'm sure hardcore users and developers would need more but this wouldn't be a phone you would look for anyway. This is a budget friendly phone that can do everything the big name phones can do for the average user (and by average I mean you social media addicts).",

For about one third the price you get a phone equal, and in some ways better.The Moto is water resistant, actually it can be briefly submerged with no problem (however it is not made for snorkeling or constant underwater use). The Gorilla glass screen is bright, clear, and really tough. The phone is lightening fast, camera takes great pics, and overall appearance is at least as good as the Samsung.Some fluff features are not present, but I cannot see even using some of those extras, like a million camera adjustments, or tons of unecessary and unwanted software. One thing lacking is a file manager and flashlight app, but they can be easily downloaded from Google Play store for free in minutes. On the upside I'd rather install the apps I want rather then have Samsung fill up the phone with stuff they think I want.All in all a very smart move, you won't go wrong with the Moto G-2, and look on eBay for a myriad of cases and other accessories. As far as some friends turning up their nose because it is not a Galaxy, the extra cash in my pocket plus having a very attractive and more capable phone gives me the last laugh.",

The screen is perfect, the dual front firing speakers are awesome, the matte back finish feels good in hand, and overall the general Android experience is pretty solid. My only gripe is the home screen tends to re-draw itself a lot after leaving an app. Maybe this will get fixed with the release of Android Lollipop? Either way, this is still a great handset if you're looking for what is essentially the stock Google experience on a phone but without having to pay a premium for the hardware.I use this on T-Mobile and get great downlink speeds on HSPA+, typically around 8-10Mbps. The battery, with my personal usage, lasts about 1-1/2 to 2 days while being to use for checking email, twitter, playing a few games, watching Plex/YouTube/Twitch, and reading a few website forums. I can push it to around 3-4 days on a single charge, possibly more, if I don't play any games or watch video. Really impressed; I can only imagine how crazy the battery life on the 1st generation Moto G was compared to the 2nd gen. That said! This is a great phone. If you're not a power smartphone user, this is the one to get. Need a backup phone to use worldwide? Get the Global GSM version of this. You won't be disappointed.",

I replaced a Samsung Rugby Smart and didn't realize it had a regular sized SIM so I had to wait a day or two to activate it. Consumer Cellular offers a version of this phone but it won't get the new Lollipop android software and this one will. I don't plan on going out of the country but I bought the global version because it was available and it gives no problems with my carrier at all. All my Rugby Smart chargers (car/house/usb) work perfectly with the Moto G so don't try and buy a lot of extra stuff for it. It does need a case in my opinion and I got a nice one from Amazon that protects it well but doesn't add to the size of it much.I've never been one who was interested in watching youtube videos or anything but this Moto G has such a dynamic screen and such great stereo speakers now I can't resist. It is truly light years ahead of the Rugby Smart although it was a good phone for me too.The size is perfect and I wouldn't want any bigger. It can still fit on my belt or in my pocket but any bigger and it wouldn't I don't think. Belt Holsters are available through Amazon too.  Really, I predict you will love this phone!",

            "comment": "Some thoughts after two weeks of ownership -Great service from Amazon, beat the estimated delivery time by several days.The phone seems to be built very well, doesn't feel cheap at all. The removable back IS plastic but has kind of a soft rubbery 'grippy' feel to it. Somewhat curved, nice. No added chrome trim or any unnecessary clutter.The screen is HUGE compared to the less than four inches that I came from. Bright, clear, plenty of room to navigate. I have a nice big weather widget on my home screen and there's plenty of room for additional app shortcuts.I'm using T-Mobile and so far, so good. Purchased the SIM card from Target for $9.99. I transferred my number from Virgin mobile no problem. $45 a month for unlimited texts and talk, 2GB data. I'm NOT a heavy data user, mainly browsing the web when I'm on a network. At home I use WI-Fi. So far after two weeks I've used 240MB of data, 2GB will be plenty for me. The H+ logo shows on my phone most of the time and pages load up quickly. Voice calls are clear, I used Skype to call my Mom in Germany (I'm in Indiana) and no issues.The phone comes with Motorola's 'Migrate' app and I used this to transfer my contacts and MMS messages from my old Android phone. It just took a couple of minutes and everything was transferred, unbelievably simple.I put a 32GB micro SD card for additional storage. All of my pictures and my apps that are able to be will be kept on the card. About 3GB is left on my internal storage so having that extra space is nice.I haven't used the camera THAT much but seems OK for the basics. I like to run them through Instagram for posting and they seem fine. The camera settings are easily accessible and I suggest you play with them a bit to get the results that you like.The phone shipped with Android 4.4.4 and having read that 5.0 was on it's way this was one main reason I wanted this phone. I was checking for updates daily both on the phone and via Motorola's 'Device Manager' program on my PC, no updates. I finally read on an Android site how to do the update manually, followed all the instructions and was able to install 5.0.1. Half a day later, I was notified that 5.0.2 was ready to install from Motorola, go figure. I've only had a couple of days on the new version but I really do like it's interface. It does seem like it uses less available RAM than what 4.4.4 was using when I check my settings. Smooth as silk so far...There is very little in the way of unneeded 'junk-ware' on the phone. As you may or not may know, most manufacturers put their own software over the top of Android, causing performance issues and making the phone a little less usable. This is almost pure Android and that's the way it should be. In my opinion, this is the way to own a cell phone, you're not tied down to a carrier and you're not paying extra every month for the privilege of using a smart phone.I gave it five stars, what the hell. I figure that it makes up for the one stars posted because the phone  was destroyed in a tragic gardening incident or fell out of a moving car and quit working.Peace",

I'd much prefer this phone over any iPhone, and the price is only a fraction the cost.  Its biggest disadvantage is that few accessories are available. However, I did find several acceptable cases, but could not find a charging dock that was made for the phone.  So I looked for any charging dock that might work and found the Belkin PowerHouse Micro USB Charge and Sync Dock.  This dock not only works nicely with the phone, but with a small modification to any case, it will also work with a case on the phone.  The modification requires only widening the hole in the case for the charging port to 1-1/4\" or more so that the case slips over a raised part of the dock. With the \"Daydream\" setting on the phone, combined with the Belkin dock, the phone now acts a convenient clock, even while asleep.",

I've had no issues at all running the android version of my iphone apps (yes, I'm trying out android),I've read all the reviews and want to address the top three negatives that people have levied against this phone:1. Pixel density of the screen is low: Noticeable if your nose is six inches from the screen and staring hard.  Otherwise a non-issue/2. Battery life: My phone lasts about 2 days between charges with light to moderate use.  I understand that's not bad for an android phone.  Your call.3. Not 4G: I don't stream movies over the phone via cellular so I can't comment on that.  For everything else that I get on line for, I've seen no speed issues whatsoever.  Makes me wonder what the payoff is for 4GLTE...For $180 bucks, it's an easy call to pick this phone up just to try it out.",

With warranty I thought my best option was to shell out $180 dollars for this phone instead of fixing my iPhone and save $120 dollars by doing so.I read extensive reviews and came to conclusion for the price this phone had the best features. I'm somewhat familiar with the Android Operating system so switching was somewhat exciting for me. This phone does not live up to Androids standards. It will frequently get veeery slow on you. You'll be accustomed to \"Unfortunately, this program had to quit.\" and poof whatever you where just doing is gone. I figured I could live with it but it soon began to eat away at me. Small features you may have become accustomed to will not be prevalent in this phone.Now, this phone isn't horrible but you'll need to learn patience using it. After two months of use I ended up getting my iPhone fixed.If you're looking for a basic phone and use it for minimal purposes, buy this phone.If you're heavy user of your phone or you're expecting a Galaxy or iPhone quality phone, stay away.",

It worked fine although it got slower as the no. of installed apps increased in a month (~10).  It has android 5.0.2. Almost half of RAM gets occupied by the bare minimum apps you download. But no, that's not it.  The phone has instantly switched off multiple times, even though the battery is full.  INSTANT BATTERY DRAIN! I have tried multiple fixes: factory reset, charging-recharging process etc. Since amazon provides only 1 month warranty, you are left with 1 year manufacturer's warranty with Motorola who doesn't even respond on phone. Plus, their policy says that most likely they will ship you a refurb phone if they cant fix this one. Otherwise, you got to pay them to ship your phone.  Apps like gmail, whatsapp and google maps take forever to open even though its only been a month. Accessing data from the data card is way too slow too.  I have no gaming apps installed. I dont think I made the best decision made in buying this phone.  So, if you dont wanna end up in the same soup as me, dont buy this phone. Buy something better.",

The curvature is excellent accommodates your less easy and perfect grip. Weighs almost nothing not felt. Regarding the battery: I think it is excellent with prolonging cell lasts me 8-9 hours, for example, every day I get up at 7 and disconnect the phone from the charger immediately and lasts me until 8-9 night, if you want to know an example right now is 8:34 and my battery percentage is 26%. The pure android software already know I love. usually difficult to find the available cell but sent it quickly brings the box, manual and charger longer than normal chargers bone .. they say everything in it is excellent, I thoroughly recommend for some reason he is the king of the midrange.",

They replaced a HTC Sensation 4G (was a flagship phone for about 15 minutes in 2011) and a cheap LG E-612 Android phone that we picked up in Australia.  Let's just say that these new phones blow our old ones out of the water.  The screens are nice and clear. Who cares if they aren't 1920x1080 pixels, they look fantastic.  They are fast, run all the apps we want and get great signal where our old phones let us down.  We're both on pre-paid plans and we get great connection speeds for our needs.  This is truly the best deal on a smartphone for those who don't wish to sign a contract with the devil to rent to own a phone for two years.",

The display is gorgeous, and overall its generally very smooth and fluid. The camera is VERY good, and performs very well in sunlight. Battery life is just normal, nothing special.There are some drawbacks , as is to be expected from a budget phone. The battery is non removable so that could be a problem for some people. It also drains pretty quickly using mobile data, but thats true for all phones. It lasts the day for me, so i'm happy. Apart from that, the phone is awesome!This phone doesnt feel like a $180 phone. You can't go wrong with it! Im recommending to all my friends here!",

Just popped my simcard in and it worked great, calls are very clear and reception is great , camera is great and shoots very clear pics, battery isn't incredible but very acceptable even with regular use, wifi connects quickly, videos run smoothly and look great in the big 5\" screen. I will update my review when I have more time with the phone but for now I love it , works great , and for less than $200 it has features than you can find on most bigger  budget phones.

You are free from the phone companies!  You are independent! Freedom!!2. Excellent Price of $179.99 - Thats all you pay for the phone. Period. No other strings attached. No carrier subsidy.3. Stock Android 4.4.4 - Virgin version of the Android software from Google. Pure software. No carrier customized junkware or bloatware. Carrier customizations of the Android software makes your phone slow, and you don't get the latest version of Android.4. Choice of Carrier is Wide open - You can switch between any carrier in a SPLIT SECOND. No worries of paying a contract termination fee.5.  OK hardware for the steller Price - Great screen. Great specs.This move by Motorola Corp is a smart smart smart smart genius move that customers love. I can't wait to get the Moto G 3rd generation phone to come out in 2015 after purchasing this for my wife.",

Since January, I have noticed a significant slow down in my phone's processing ability, even after keeping all apps and Android OS up to date.  The nail in the coffin just came yesterday when after reaching 0% battery (practically a daily occurrence), I was unable to charge the phone.  I have left the phone on the charger overnight and still no sign of life.  My advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!  I used to love my older Motorola phones, but unless they pull some fantastic customer support, consider this my last purchase with their brand!",

Yet, the hardware they put into their phones is mostly on the lower end.  Don't throw your money away.  Screen on G is larger with similar resolution to iPhone. Rear cameras are both 8mp but G has better front camera with 2mp (versus 1.5mp for apple). Both have 1GB of ram.  G only has 8GB internal storage but can easily add more with cheap micro SD card. G has 720p video and iPhone has 1080p.  The biggest difference between the phones is the iPhone has noticeably faster processor with better graphics processor. Games will load and run better on the iPhone.  If games are a priority, get the iPhone. Otherwise, for your everyday tasks the G is just as good and in some ways better. Update to the new Android Lollipop OS and enjoy the fantastic new UI. It's gorgeous and every bit as good as iOS and then some.",

The phone may get little laggy when you have a lot of ongoing tasks (due to just 1 GB ram) but you can keep on closing unused windows and clear RAM in a timely manner to get good performance. As long as you dont overload the phone with hardware intensive softwares it works great for day to day use on browsing, emails, YouTube, music, and social networking apps. And ya, I enjoy the 5 inch screen on this phone.",

You shouldn't notice a difference between this screen and those Full HD screens on higher end phones. Thanks to Motorola's light skin, the phone doesn't lag one bit.

I am in US and bought the global version.. no worries.. it works fine on ATT network coverage, and I've even read that it works on most of the Sprint network that it was supposed to not cover as well..

I wish it came default with 16gb internal, but the good news is it takes larger cards than the 32gb cards the description lists as maximum size. I have a 64gb card in it now, which is the largest size I had, and after formating it in phone, it took it with no problems. It is limited a little by the 1gb ram as well, but not extensively. Biggest thing I see is the \"desktop\" page redraws. Every once in a while, the touch screen is glitchy, but more an annoyance than anything serious. I would recommend to anyone wanting an off contract US or International phone. I got an international version for use in Africa.",

I would do it again. The battery takes somewhat longer to recharge. It seems to last longer than my 4S did. The price was great. I bought it from amazon warehouse. These are returns and open box items. Saved close to $30. I would have a hard time going back to a top of the line phone when this does all I need.",

So be extra careful holding it or buy a really good case with it.",

Believe it or not the dual speakers on the front actually provide louder sound than the HTC I had.  If you're debating on buying this phone I suggest you stop thinking about it and go ahead with the purchase!  Thumbs up Motorola",

            "comment": "I don't need a $400 -- $600+ fashion statement, or reconfirmation of my self-image.  I can also do without a few megapixels on the camera, when they do little more than clog the upload pipes.So far (less than two weeks), this is exactly what I was looking for - a reasonably-priced, updated replacement for my increasingly unstable Google Nexus 4 (N4).  This 2nd gen  Moto G's Android Lollipop version may not be quite up to the same revision as the Nexus, but it also doesn't shut-down or freeze frequently, yet,  Given the current state of the art of enforced obsolescence and controlled lack of quality, I expect this will soon start.  But, I'm still hoping for a good 6-8 months or so.Display is nice - better & brighter than the N4, and certainly good enough.  Touch response better than the N4, but I haven't put a screen protector on, yet.  I love an abundance of power in nearly everything, but I don't yet find a need for an excessive amount in a typical smartphone (at least not without enterprise-level MDMs and VPNs).  While I would have liked to have kept NFC, and added LTE, so far, I don't miss either.  If I wanted better security, I'd get a new Blackberry or (yes, I never thought I'd say it) Windows 8 or 10 phone (don't troll me about SE Android - let alone iOS).  Android app response it better with this Moto - the processor speed seems to be a significant improvement over the N4.  I lost 8 gb of internal memory compared to my N4, but the micro-SD memory expansion slot will probably be better for my needs. USB to go seems to function well (limited testing, so far)Speed, sensitivity and network functionality on T-Mobile's network seems to be at least as good as the N4 - I still get 3G+ in all the places I used to, and probably a few more. (I may miss lack of LTE someday) .  Voice clarity might be a touch better on the Moto (I still think smartphones are the stupidest way to talk on a telephone yet invented - kind of like talking into a board on the side of your face during an intercontinental HF Ham radio telephone relay to Africa during the cold war).  I find the same network dead spots and extended registration times in a particular urban area that I've been complaining about for years, but they may be slightly smaller.  I'm not often a video streamer, but when I do it's pretty heavy - this phone is head and shoulders better than the N4.  My home doesn't have good cell signal from anyone, so I rely on Wi-Fi there for bandwidth.  This seems to work better than he N4; better range and slightly higher speed using 802.11n.  I'll probably miss not having 802.11ac capability soon, but not yet.Yes, the case is plastic.  You can support the PRC economy and try all the Moto shells you like, if that's an issue.Bottom line: Maybe not perfect, but very good and excellent value.  Highly recommended, so far.",

            "comment": "This is an excellent phone and it is the best android phone under the $200 range.Pro:----- Excellent reception and call quality.----- Big 5\", gorgeous, bright and crisp 294ppi screen (gorilla glass)----- Very fast and responsive. 1GB Ram is typical for this price range and it actually works really well with Lollipop 5.0.2. I have a ton of apps and had plenty of background apps running and the phone is still very fast and lag free. I do recommend Clean Master app with 1 tap boost button. It is an excellent app that frees some of the RAM.----- Lollipop 5.0.2 came with my phone. It is an awesome operating system that is fast, looks great and is easy to use. I really think it is a big improvement over kitkat with all the new features. I heard some people complain about lag but I haven't experienced any of that. Last time I checked, I even had 18 apps running in the background and the phone was still very fast and responsive.----- Very nice 8mp camera with flash. It gets the job done for me but I am not the type of person who takes a ton of pictures or considered a \"camera expert\". The pictures and video footage look great and the user interface is user friendly with plenty of options for more advanced user.----- Speakers sound loud and clear with good bass. With the headphones, music even sounds better. Very happy with the sound.----- Unlocked phone! It gives me options.----- Accepts Micro SD card. Even though 8gb is too little of storage, Motorola fixed the problem by letting the phone accept Micro SD card. I put a 32gb Micro SD card in mine.Con----- Battery life! This is my first \"large screen\" smartphone so I am not used to short term battery life. With my smaller screen Windows Lumia phone, I can easily go couple days without charging. I think windows operating system is just more efficient than android when it comes to using RAM and battery power. I think with the large 5\" screen and the lollipop system with so many running background apps, it uses a lot of unnecessary RAM and battery power. I noticed the \"Power through your day with the all-day battery\" in the description as if that is something to brag about. In my opinion, every phone better last a full day and they should last 2 days on one charge with regular use. I'm using Clean Master app and disabled lot of unnecessay app notifications so I may squeeze a \"One and half day\" battery power now. Maybe in the future I will get Lollipop 5.1 or another update that will improve battery life. I will look into getting a cheap portable battery charger too.----- Not 4G LTE capable.... Not a big deal for me though.Conclusion: Amazing phone with a bargain price, great specs, awesome features and an impressive Lollipop 5.0.2 operating system. All the pros easily compensates for the lackluster battery life. If you are a lesser user, you may get a day and a half battery use. I highly recommend this phone and I would rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "comment": "Just to preface this, I came to this mobile after owning a carrier branded Galaxy S3 for just over 2 years.This mobile. Oh gosh this mobile. I think the best way to discribe it is indeed, the highest of the low end. However, don't let that push you away. For the price it's hard to find a better android experience, even more so if you manage to find a used (but in good condition) or refurbished model for cheaper. It is however not all sunshine and rainbows.Let's start with the bad. The worst part of this device for me is the internal storage. Eight gigabites is just, abysmaly small for most these days. Yes you can work around it, and Motorola does alow you to move some apps to a micro SD card (which this will handle up to 32gigs of aditional storage* but I cannot find a way to install directly to the SD card from the app market. This means going through a rather annoying process of juggling apps around to get everything installed, and I find that apps will be transfered back over to the internal storage whenever there's an update. Very frustrating. I also found that the handset feels just a little bulky in the hand. Not neccissarily big, it's no Galaxy Note, but just a little more sizeable than I'd appreciate. The memory also can be a problem from time to time. This is not a mobile for the heavy multitasker, and I find it being a bit more agressive about closing apps if I switch around just barely too much. (This does depend on the apps used of course, as some will have no issue with this while others will be notoriously bad)However, that's about all I can really complain about. Aside from the lean storage, memory, and perhaps needing to go on a diet, I'm very happy with everything else. The diplay is plenty sharp and and bright, the camera takes good qulity stills and videos, both rear and front facing, but by far my favorite part is the speakers. No, they're not great speakers but just the fact that they're front facing, and yes you get two of them by the way, make them so much louder and clearer than most other devices I've seen. They may not be Boom Sound or Beats, but for under 200 USD I'd argue they're still hard to beat. I also love how close to stock the android experience feels on this mobile. Motorola have quickly become one of my favorite OEMs for android handsets just by how little they mess with the operating system. Very light skinning, a few custom apps which you do not have to use if you don't want to (and can even disable so you don't have to so much as see them) and that's your lot. Call quality has been great, and even though it may not have LTE, I find that HSPA works plenty fast enough for my needs. I'm currently going through Simple Mobile for my plan and data speeds have never been an issue with this mobile.In short, if you're looking for a mobile on the cheaper end of the spectrum but still want something nice, and you don't mind taking a hit on internal storage or memory, I cannot recomend the Moto G 2014 more",

On my Moto g 2nd Gen. with Lollipop OS when I put the brightness of the display on automatic (adaptive display) the screen will go dark when I am indoors with low light..  One cannot see anything on the screen - the phone is useless.  If one goes outside in daylight the screen is readable.  I have other phones and tablets with automatic display adjustment and the screen dims in indoors or low light - but the screen is clearly readable and usable.  A search of the internet indicates that others have the same problem with their Moto g 2nd Gen.  I have read several professional reviews of the Moto g 2nd Gen. and no one has discusses a problem the the adaptive display adjustment; how is this possible.  How many others have the same problem.  Is Motorola planning a bug fix for this automatic display brightness?",

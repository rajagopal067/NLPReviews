I generally prefer Apple products, especially computers, but in all honesty I like the user-friendliness as much or better on this phone than on iPhones/iPads (I do use both often at work and most of my family are iPhone users). Especially if you are a major Google/Gmail user like me, having an Android is excellent. This phone is pretty comparable in screen size to the iPhone 6, though not as slim, but still very good slimness and weight. Feels very durable, display is very crisp and clear, and the camera is great. Apps are easy to use, organize, and download, and they look sharp. The notification LED is nice and subtle, not obnoxious.Cons: At first I really disliked that the only text display throughout the phone menus is white text/black background because my eyes hate that, but I got used to it, so it's not that big of a deal. Maybe they've changed that in newer phones, if not they probably should. Battery is built in, so you can't really pull it out as a reset option if your phone freaks out for any reason. Speaking of which, the biggest con was a freak-out that apparently is somewhat common from what I've seen in looking for a solution online: the dreaded boot loop, where the phone gets stuck in an endless cycle of trying to boot up and never succeeding. I don't know that it's specific to this model or just Androids in general, but a lot of people online seemed to have it happen to their Moto Gs. From what I understand, it can be a result of buggy apps or people trying to get fancy with custom programming, but I didn't do any of that and it just up and entered boot loop for no apparent reason. I just got a replacement under warranty, so it's not the end of the world, but just be aware that it can happen and this model might be particularly susceptible. Only other con is that there aren't many cases to choose from right now, but that doesn't affect how the phone works!I do love this phone, despite the random defect that I ended up with, but overall it's still worth 5 stars for functionality and quality!",

A few notes before I begin my review: I'm running Android 5.0 Lollipop, not KitKat which it ships with. Also, I upgraded from a very s***ty MetroPCS phone (LG Optimus L9) so I might exaggerate its greatness to some extent.1) Build Quality: The phone's back feels kind of slippery and hard to grip, but that can be easily solved by a phone case. The phone's screen does not attract fingerprints as much as others I have had.2) Screen Quality: The screen is very crispy and bright. 720p HD does not look as good as it does on my 1080p tv or laptop for example, but it is good enough for me. The screen is very responsive and excellent overall.3) Microphone Quality: Good enough4) Speaker quality: This part BLEW ME AWAY! I have never heard a better speaker system on a cell phone, especially since this phone's speakers HAVE BASS! It can get a little \"muddy\" as it gets very loud though. But, a pro is: it gets EXTREMELY loud.5) Headphone Jack: Quality6) Processing speed: Very fast. I recommend watching a youtube video to see comparisons. Apps loud up almost instantly. The only app that is even remotely close to slow is deer hunter 2014.7) space: I havent had any problem. I've installed severall apps and I have 5 gbs left plus the 16 gb memory card I have installed.8) Price: I paid 179.99 on amazon, but you can certainly get it cheaper as the amount of risks you're willing to take increases.9) Video quality: Youtube defaults to 360p, but runs 720p fine for most videos. Some look better than others. it depends really.10) Battery life: 4 hours 30 minutes for heavy use, not sure for casual use. By heavy I mean nearly constant use, with videos, web browsing, games, and brightness on 100%, and several apps open11) RAM: Good but you can definitely notice when you have too many apps open12: Camera qualilty: Excellent13) Front Camera quality: Good, but good lighting is a must14) Video quality: very good15) speakerphone: below average strangely16) Charger port:: Makes me feel like I'm going to break it every time I pull it out.",

            "comment": "I purchased this phone last Monday from a Best Buy for the same price (It was out of stock here on Amazon, as well as on Motorola's website)I was in need of a new phone, as my 3 year old HTC Amaze 4G gave up on me (Stopped recognizing the SIM card, despite cleaning the slot, and even opening the phone up to ensure that the board had a good connection to the main board).  Lets compare the Moto G to HTC's 2011 flagship phone:Both have 8MP rear facing cameras, with excellent quality, however, the camera software that came preloaded with the Amaze has more features, and you are able to control the camera's focus a bit betterAs far as front facing cameras go, the Moto won by a long shot. The HTC's front facing camera was only 1.3MP, as well as the fact that the camera was situated so close to the screen's edge that dust got into the phone, and onto the lens, so pictures were very dull and blurry.  In contrast,the Motorola's front facing camera is very crisp and clear.Battery life-  I had 4 batteries, for the HTC, so I think you could safely assume that battery life on the HTC was terrible.  The Moto tends to last me about 14 hours per charge, with about 5 hours of on-screen time, which is wonderful.Display-  Ignoring screen size, as some people prefer smaller screens, whereas other people prefer larger screens, the display on the moto is better.  The HTC's 256PPI display is a bit pixilated when compared to the moto's 294PPI.- That may not sound like a large difference, but I can tell immediately when handling the HTC. They do not have to be side by side to be able to tell.  The Moto's display is a bit more saturated than the HTC's more vibrant display, however.Speakers- I cannot comment on the quality of the HTC's loud speaker, as it was damaged by water over a year ago, and has been extremely muddy and staticy sounding ever since, however, I can compare the Moto's speakers to the Nexus 7 2013's speakers in terms in quality, however, I find the front firing speakers better in that they don't get muffled.Performance- The HTC's 1.5GHz dual core processor and 1GB of RAM does not compete with the Moto's 1.2GHz quad core and 1GB of ram.  I see absolutely no delays when using the Moto (besides when first turning it on, but that is to be expected).I formatted the HTC to give it a fair chance against the Moto, and it just did not perform.  The Moto is just much more fluid.The HTC got stuck on Android 4.0.3, whereas, the Moto, although currently on 4.4.4, is promised to be updated to Android L.For $180, you absolutely cannot go wrong.I see no reason to take away stars for its lack of NFC (hardly ever used anyway) or LTE(HSPA+ is fast on T Mobile)",

            "comment": "I wasn't sure how much I could expect at the $180 price point, but I love this phone, so I have to leave a detailed review.Build Quality: 9/10Alright, first, I haven't used many phones. However, I still have a bit of perspective. Build quality here is better than expected. Although the case is only plastic, it feels durable. The phone is completely solid and snug, there are no flexible hollow spots, and there are no ill-fitting parts. The phone does not flex at all (that's a good thing). The screen is Gorilla Glass 3. I'd say the build quality is much better than the Shield Tablet and noticeably better than the Galaxy S3. Even against the higher end Galaxy Note 10.1, the Moto G doesn't lose too badly, and at the $180 price point I haven't felt anything even close to this solid and aesthetically pleasing.Interface: 9/10This is almost stock Android Kit-Kat. There's almost no bloatware, and the bit that's present may actually be useful (seems to mostly be safety features). Everything is smooth, and free of hang-ups. It feels similar to my Shield Tablet in that regard, even though the tablet has much stronger flagship specs. The UI is simply light and easy to run smoothly. Additionally, an Android L update has been promised. Apps generally load quickly, though in a few heavy ones the Snapdragon 400 hangs for a second. Still, that's much better than expected for a phone at this price, and I've found the Moto G is actually smoother and snappier than some more expensive, higher spec Samsung devices burdened by the Touchwiz UI. My only real complaint is that some devices offer the option to hide the hardware buttons manually, but as far as I'm aware, the Moto G has to rely on apps to handle that instead.Gaming: 6/10Well, this phone had to have at least one weakness. The Adreno 305 is only capable of so much, and the relatively high resolution for a phone of this class puts extra strain on the GPU in games. Minecraft PE runs almost maxed at 25-30 fps, which is easily playable, but not particularly smooth. The Great Martian War is a lower spec game, and runs great maxed. Block Story runs almost maxed at playable frame rates, probably about the same as Minecraft. Given with how the Adreno 305 struggles to max MCPE and Block Story, I have no doubt you'd have to turn the graphics down in intensive or worse optimized games. Additionally, as an Adreno GPU, it obviously lacks advanced Tegra effects. Still, these gaming shortcomings are easily forgivable when the rest of the phone exceeds expectations, and even the Adreno 305 still makes MCPE (my favorite Android game) look really nice. Budget phone gamers should still look elsewhere.Camera: 8/10The cameras are very much in line with what you'd expect at this price. Colors are a bit washed out by default, so it's really just more realistic to leave HDR mode on all the time. Oddly enough, the 8mp main camera looks a bit blurrier than expected, while the 2mp \"selfie\" camera actually looks better than expected. They both seem to meet in the middle, roughly matching the 5mp cameras in sharpness in my Shield Tablet. The camera controls are simple, and with HDR enabled there's not much left to complain about except a noticeable (but not severe) lack of sharpness in the 8mp camera.Screen: 9/10The screen gets quite bright, and seems fairly readable in sunlight. That's very rare in a sub-$300 phone. Since this is an IPS panel blacks are always going to be fairly deep, and never look merely gray. Colors are accurate, comparable to my shield tablet or a well-calibrated LED TV, and the 720p resolution is higher than usual for this price. Not up to AMOLED quality, but that's a $500 feature and this is a $180 phone. Do the math. You won't find better for the price outside of a couple Nokia Lumia devices, which historically worship screen quality and neglect specs. My only complaint is that the viewing angles are a bit low for an IPS display.Battery: 8/10There's a pretty big disparity between gaming battery life and general battery life. I mean, an even bigger gap than usual. Battery life is excellent in general use, I could easily see a single charge lasting a full day or more with moderate use. However, games really eat the battery in just a couple hours. I suspect it goes back to the weaker Adreno 305 I mentioned before; a lower end GPU is simply not cut out to handle extended gaming sessions efficiently. Still, not a big issue. Gamers should be looking for a Tegra K1 or an Adreno 330 anyway.Speaker/voice quality: 8/10The speaker is actually pretty nice for a phone. It didn't butcher my Finnish Gothic Doom Metal as badly as I expected, games and notifications are crisp and loud, and voice is accurately recreated. Still... It's a cell phone. You can only do so much with a speaker rhe size of a dime. Get a nice Bluetooth speaker or headphones if you expect to listen to much music.Connection Stability: 10/10I'm in a concrete basement in a rural area, surrounded by trees, and I'm still at 3/4 bars of signal strength. Occasionally 4/4 bars. My 3G connection is much faster than my Wifi here. It'd be hard to stress a signal more than this unless you literally live off the grid. Epic connection (and nice coverage as well, AT&T).Perks: 10/10A splash resistant phone is practically unheard of for less than $300, yet the Moto G incorporates this feature for half the price. Additionally, the forward facing speakers, clicky tactile buttons, gorilla glass 3 screen, notification light, rubberized ergonomic shape, and microSD slot are all features that elevate the Moto G 2014 above its spartan competition at the $180 price point.Overall, great build quality, great UI/OS, weakish gaming, average camera, good sound, great screen, good battery, great reliability, great perks, and an amazing price. Motorola compromised in exactly the right places to make a ridiculously efficient, reliable, and well designed phone that feels more expensive than it really is. Despite the weak specs on paper, skilled design has allowed Motorola to maintain fluid and non-frustrating performance in everything except the heaviest apps, and this is clearly a more practical approach than the competition is using.",

            "comment": "Build Quality:------------------The shell is constructed from matte finish plastic which I think is a perfect material for such a commodity device. It's not too slippery like most metal phones, and not too shiny like cheap plastic from Samsung. This one feels good to grip and has enough weight in it to feel substantial. Though the screen size has gone up, Motorola have reduced bezels and kept overall size still compact enough. I think it's the sweet spot between being large enough for watching media and small enough to be pocketable.Display:-----------It's grown up to 5 inches from the 4.5 inch display on the old Moto G. While still at 720p, it has good brightness, colors, and contrast that make it a pleasure to look at. Pixel density is lower, but doesn't bother everyday use at all. Pictures and videos do look sharp enough. Webpages are fine. IPS panel keeps is plenty bright and auto brightness works well (Not too aggressive).Performance:------------------This is the best part. This phone has Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor that's two years old. And just 1 GB RAM. That might set your expectations very low.But coupled with unskinned stock android, the UI feels fresh and responsive. It is able to take the most out of it's rather average internals. This is one of the few phones which makes you forget about the specs and just use it. It just works! Like an iPhone (Only for 1/3rd of the price). It will shame most high end Android phones from Samsung, LG for smoothness in operation.Apps load smoothly, transitions and animations are fluid. It's just that the most graphically demanding apps will take time to load. But again, what do you expect for $179? Daily activities like emails, social networking, light games, music, youtube videos.... No problem at all!Battery life:---------------It's a little disappointing that Motorola went with the same sized battery at 2070 mAH. But this is not an issue since all of the other components are same. 720p display really helps here. This phone will get you through a full day with average use.But if they come out with an LTE model later (like 2013), they better bump the battery up to at least 2200 mAH. Most people will happily pay $25-30 extra for that.Camera:------------No big surprises here. It's a usable camera and will take decent shots in well lit environments. Fewer settings to meddle with, HDR is on by default. All this helps. The resolution is bumped up from 5 MP on last gen to 8 MP here. Casual shots won't be a problem. Just don't expect this to match high end phone shooters from Samsung, Apple, LG, Nokia and Sony.Overall:----------This is perfect example of how a product is a lot more than the sum of it's parts. In the 4-5 years that I've owned Android phones, never have I seen such a clever optimization of hardware and software (at sub $200 price) which works wonderfully. Seriously, mid-range specs shouldn't mean crappy performance. The whole experience matters and not the specs. This Moto demonstrates it. Also it will keep you contract free and save you a lot of money.Android is lately feeling like a more pleasant ecosystem. It always had ton of apps and functionality, but now it also shines in terms of performance and smoothness. Optimizations in version 4.4 Kitkat have really helped it become much more stable, smooth and responsive. Also the latest Lollipop 5.0 gives it a much needed visual overhaul. All this comes together beautifully to make it feel a lot user friendly. This helps phones like Moto G a lot.Pros:- Big, bright 5 inch 720p display (Yes, I count 720p as a pro for battery life)- Super cheap price tag- Reasonable performance- Upgraded 8MP camera- Great front facing speakers (Though they may distort a bit at highest volume, they're great for casual youtube sessions)- MicroSD expansion slotCons:1. Lack of LTE (However motorola may surprise us like a LTE version that came out after Moto G (2013). Really nothing much else.",

            "comment": "Best smartphone for the money. Hasn't lagged, on me yet. Upgraded from the Galaxy Nexus and I'm glad I did. The screen is beautiful and while the size took some getting used to (coming from a smaller phone) it was a much better option than the other big devices that are taking over now. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the 8GB of space- which fills up quickly but it's made me keep my picture gallery curated. Using Dropbox I just turn on the camera upload feature and delete the older pix that I don't need immediately present on my device. The interface is almost stock Android which is what I really liked about the Nexus- no other mess that you don't really use anyway. And whatever I do want is available in the Play store.This phone is cheap enough that if I drop it or damage it somehow I won't cry when it comes time to replace it (i'm not even rocking a case/ screen protector on this baby)- But it feels and responds like a device that costs much more. I'm having a hard time telling the subtle differences between this and more expensive devices.... aka \"flagship\" phones. For the things I use a phone for (sending/ checking emails, calling, texting, occasional games, tweeting) this is more than enough. The charger that comes with the phone looks pretty good (it's white instead of the usual shiny black) but it charges so very slow. No worries cause I have my old chargers still and they speed things up. Battery lasts most of the day and that's with me using it at least 15 mins every hr. No signal issues. Motorola assist keeps notifying me that \"GPS must be on and set to high accuracy\" to do it's thing but I uninstalled the latest update and disabled the app and it hasn't bugged me since. That's not an issue w/ the phone so much as an issue with the app Motorola put out (which many other apps can replicate the functionality). Hangouts and Messaging are on the phone- hangouts will soon be the standard, and only, messaging app for Android. You can disable Hangouts but not Messaging (I don't understand why). Call volume is good and the speakers aren't bad. My daughter has the first gen device and she likes it. Can't go wrong with either one at the price.Spend your cash, you won't be disappointed.",

            "comment": "After four weeks of use the negatives start to add up:- Since there is no physical front button the power button is the only way to wake up the phone. But the power button is hard to reach, requires significant pressure, and has no good feedback. So I find myself having to pick up the phone and pushing the button repeatedly,  so waking up the phone is unnecessarily cumbersome.- Android Lollipop is a step backwards as far as I can tell. It is full on gratuitous animations and 'improvements' that make the phone harder to use and slower to respond, for example the needlessly fancy 'recently used apps' functionality that is slow because of the stupid animations and forces me to flip through every app I've used in the last weeks. And what about the handy functionality the power button used to have, like mute/vibrate, airplane mode, and restart? Android 4.4 was much easier to use. Lots of negatives, and I can hardly see anything in Lollipop that actually makes the phone better.- A serious usability issue: If the screen is off (sleeping or locked) then an incoming phone call does not wake up the screen. I have to push the power button, unlock the screen, and then can finally pick up the call (if it hasn't dropped by then). The issue is with the screen lock function, it's reproducible and affects many people. Moto needs to fix this ASAP.- Finally - the phone is needlessly bulky due to it's curved back.It does have a few good features, like the stereo front speakers and the decent screen, but overall the usability issues are too severe to make this a phone I like.",

Good for someone that does not really need 4G.  And... the non removalable battery.  If you don't need the \"Cadillac\" then this phone may have everything you need. For the price it negates all of the above.  The phone has a five inch screen.  Other purchasers have already covered this phone well.  If you have Consumer Cellular read below:FYI, if you are not aware Consumer Cellular is on the AT&T network. Since the phone was not purchased from Consumer Cellular some changes needed to be made to make the phone fully functional as specified by Consumer Cellular's U.S. based support. For example MMS messaging will not work with the out of the box settings.After placing your existing or new sim into the phone, powering up and getting the first power on \"settled\" go to the following menu:Settings->More->Mobile Networks->Access Point Names->ccilte/ccdata  (There will only be one choice, maybe not ccilte/ccdata, just select default name to edit)If the settings below are different modify if necessary.Name=ccilteAPN=ccdataProxy=not setPort=not setUsername=not setPassword=not setServer=http://mmsc.mobile.att.netMMSC=http://mmsc.mobile.att.netMMS proxy=proxy.mobile.att.netMMS port=80MCC=310MNC=410Authenticatopn type=PAPAPN type=default,mms,supl,hipriAPN protocol=IPv4APN roaming protocol=IPv4APN enable/disable=APN enabledBearer=UnspecifiedMVNO type=GIDMVNO value=2AC9",

I've had this phone about a month.  I'm currently unemployed because of a disability and this is my only access to the internet.  Therefore, my phone usage is currently above average.Pros:Beautiful displayPretty snappy performanceLove having swype keyboardLollipop 5.0.2 is beautiful and functional3G is pretty fastDecently priced unlocked phoneNot too much bloatwareFront facing speakers are pretty goodCamera is good for the priceCons:Battery is average (I thought with all the hype it would impress, while it's not bad, it could be better, but I can't buy a different battery because it isn't removable, I might not have to charge it twice a day when I start working again though)I wish there were more customization options available without having to rootNot a lot of RAM or internal storage (after Facebook, I only have approx 3 gigs internal, all of my other large apps are on my SD card, which I have had no problem mounting/unmounting)With weather getting hotter, we need phones that can maintain temps.  This phone does well, but I can tell on a scorcher I would have to be careful, anything over 50 degrees Celsius and the phone dragsThat's about it.  The cons are not enough for me to take any stars away because they don't hinder my experience enough.  When all is said and done, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!",

            "comment": "I have had this phone for about 2 months now and I feel like this is a good time to write my review (I promise I will keep this to the point). For a $180 you cant go wrong with this phone. My prior phone was the HTC One M7 that I got with Sprint. I got this phone because I did not have the money to buy a $600+ phone. The screen size of this phone is just what I wanted. The button placement is alright, I would've preferred the volume button on the left side of the phone but with everything being on the right side you get used to it pretty quick. The color reproduction is good for a phone in this price range and the 720p screen is also good. The 8MP camera is an upgrade from my HTC M7 camera but there is not a lot of settings to play with and there is no autofocus ( you have to manually adjust it). So far my pictures come out great, nothing like the iPhone, G4, or the S6. Now android Lollipop, good thing about Motorola phones is that they are very close to stock android and Google Now is just amazing. What I don't like to much is the hardware. The 1GB ram is just not enough and I cannot emphasize this enough. For the most part this phone works flawlessly, but try to do more than one thing at once get ready to meet your new friend LAG! 2 times now the phone has frozen on me, the whole phone becomes unresponsive, you can't even restart the phone which means you have to wait for the battery to drain. I would give this phone 4 stars because almost everything else on this phone is just what I wanted but the 1GB of ram does not do this phone justice.",

            "comment": "Bear in mind while reading this that the Moto G is my first smartphone.I got mine directly through Verizon brand new for $99 + first month of prepaid service up front, tax and shipping. I opted for the 4GB data plan so I pay $70/mo.Form factor:Lightweight, slender, and RIDICULOUSLY durable. All of my friends who own an iPhone have at one point dropped it and broken the screen. I have personally dropped this phone dozens of times and have never had as much as a scratch on the screen. Some dings in the shell and rips in the case but the screen and phone do appear to be indestructible! This is probably the #1 reason you should get this phone because phones do take a beating, and even if this does break the price point is low enough to replace fairly easily. Everything else is just a bonus.Through Motorola you can also get a fancy cover that folds over the screen and opens and closes like a book. Does a great job of protecting the screen and preventing unwanted button presses while in your pocket. Locks the phone when the book cover closes.Storage: my only real sticking point to be honest. 3-4GB of on phone storage although you do get several gigs more through google drive for free. No SD card slot but you can mount an external drive directly to the phone or connect to a PC.Battery life: incredible. I use the heck out of this phone for work and I STILL get 8-10 hours of continuous, heavy use out of the battery. Easily several days with light to moderate use. About 1.5-2 hours to fully recharge.Price:I got mine through Verizon for $100. Can't beat that value...!Operating system: Android. Stable, reliable, frequent software updates, TONS of 3rd party apps and customizing through the OS. I do periodically experience crashes but the phone reboots so quick I hardly notice.Summary:PRO: price, durability, performance, OSCONS: onboard storageOverall: Extremely satisfied with this phone except the low onboard storage, but then I get a ton of cloud storage through google drive so it is basically a non issue for me.Get this phone.",

            "comment": "The short of it is I like simple phones. I don't like the fancy skins on some other Android phones and I don't want to buy in to the Apple cult to get a simple phone. I have owned several smart phones - Palm, a few Blackberries, several Droids and even a short affair with an iPhone 5s. So I speak with some experience when I say this phone is fantastic! Cheap, fast, decent battery life and great 5 inch screen. The phone is just about a perfect weight and size for my hand (mens XL) and the arched back makes it very pleasant to hold. Reception is great and data speeds are WiFi like. The lack of 4G LTE does not seem to be a problem I get solid HSPA+ (equivalent to 4G) in areas of good coverage and pages snap open in the browser. I bought the global GSM version since the US version was not available when I ordered and it works fine on ATT. Buying the unlocked GSM saves me fifteen dollars a month on my plan, $360 over two years, so I'm saving quite a bit going with this phone over a more expensive phone.I really hope that Lenovo keeps going in this direction when they take over Motorola Mobility next year. Google took the company in the perfect direction the last two years, create the best high end phone, the Moto X, but also put out top notch affordable phones like the G.",

This enables a smooth running Android System and a greater availability of the internal storage for the user.This smartphone fulfills the needs of many people who are paying for \"high end\" phone, but for s third of the price. So if you're looking for a new phone take a moment to review what you really need your cell phone for, that way you may save a lot of money by going with the Moto G.",

Purchased this after having an incredibly positive experience with the first-gen Moto G, only to find that this stutters and freezes, and seizes during the most common of processes. I can only imagine that it's because of the Lollipop update, but the phone frequently acts as if it's unable to adequately run the OS.It's also started notifying me that the battery has completely discharged, even after it's been on the charger all day. Also, the smaller battery is incredibly disappointing in contrast to the earlier iteration.I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to a OnePlus One, but I regret that decision almost daily. I consider myself a \"casual\" user, so I assumed that this would carry the same reliability that the first-gen garnered, but I've quickly discovered how mistaken I was. I've owned this phone for barely two months now, and I will be purchasing a OnePlus One and selling this on eBay. One positive aspect is that the camera is much better than the previous generation, but after several consecutive pictures, the native camera app begins to lag and stutter and noticeably freeze.I hate the fact that I'm forced to purchase another phone, albeit far superior, but I just don't trust this phone anymore.",

I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 (Sprint), but it would not work on T-Mobile's network. The Samsung Galaxy S4 or S5 at T-Mobile would have cost at least $600. I did not want to pay that much for a phone. This phone came new, in-the-box, unlocked (you can use it with any service provider you want without having to extend your service contract). After doing some research YouTube and online, I found out about the Motorola Moto G 2nd generation. Though not in the same league with the Samsung Galaxy S5, I can tell you after having used it for a few months, I have no complaints. It does everything I need it to do. In comparison to my Samsung Galaxy S4, the main thing I miss is not being able to use it as a remote for my tv or Apple TV because it does not have an IR blaster. Other than that, I am quite happy with this phone. The best thing about this phone is I was able to cancel the $7 to $10 per month insurance on my plan and not worry if I drop or break it. If it breaks, worst case is I have to spend another $180 to replace it. I don't know about you, but I'll take $180 over $600+ any time.",

            "comment": "I have been using this phone now since October 2013.. It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S2. The call quality is good and the screen is great and is very responsive. The battery life is good for me it lasts a day and a half with just basic usage. I have had some issues with images I have received disappearing from the gallery or showing up blank.  I don't get as good a signal inside my house with this phone as i did the old Galaxy S2 and it doesn't  make a beep when charging or completed charging but it does charge much faster than my old S2. All in all I am happy with it. One thing I really don't like is It's difficult to tell when this phone is laying down which way is the top. I wish it had a label or something identifying the top of the phone since when I have it laying on my dark granite counter top  it's very hard to tell with a cursory glance looking down at the phone which way is up unless the message light is flashing.  I am not saying it's impossible i can see the tiny message indicator or the headphone jack at the top it's just more difficult than i think it should be.  They could have removed one of the silvers bars at the bottom or made one of the bars a different size or put a trademark on the front of the phone.  Anything to help indicate which is the top of the phone.Pros.Great quality screenPerfect size not too large (phablet) or too small.FastCharges battery much quicker than my old galaxy S2.ConsI don't get as good a reception inside my house as i did with my old Galaxy SIIIt needs some kind of label or identifier to tell which is top and bottom.No charging beep or alert when it's finished charging.",

When I was able to turn the phone on, it performed as most claim. However, turning the phone on was a larger concern than I ever thought possible. If you buy this phone, I suggest making sure you never need to turn it off. When I decided to turn off my phone, en-route to my wedding, I found that to my dismay that this phone refused to turn back on. Instead of last minute flowers, I had an experience I would not wish upon anyone. After four hours with the Motorola service line, listening to people with little English skills ask me to read what my still unresponsive phone displayed on its lifeless screen, I decided to give up hope. To add insult to injury, the IMEI number for the phone is not the same as the one printed on the back. If you do want to get help, you must turn the phone on and ask it to tell you this number, a modern day Catch-22.With 10 minutes on Google, I found a temporary fix (Use a stronger charger, not the one helpfully provided by Motorola) that seemed to solve my problems. However, I have found that every few months my phone decides to repeat the performance, culminating with the recent episode, from which it has yet to recover. I am searching for a new phone, but rest assured that this phone, despite its tantalizing reviews and specifications, will not be on my list.",

The phone links to your google account so you can keep up your calendar, your email, and anything else you do with google.  It also has security - if your phone is stolen - a link to Motorola will clear the phone.  The Motorola G2 has an SD slot so you can add up to 32G of storage.  A real bonus if you want extra apps.  I use it with Consumer Cellar which is working great for me.  Consumer Cellar has an app that allows you to manage your subscriptions real time.  The manual for the phone is okay but since most of the operation of the phone comes from the Android operating system, you find the best information on using it from Android sites.  (Consumer Cellar has videos on how to use the Motorola G1 which apply to the G2.)  The phone has the latest Android OS which is upgradable, Bluetooth, Wifi, and GPS.  (I did have to call Consumer Cellar to get the data feature to work.)  By the way, this is a GSM phone and is running off the AT&T network.  If your carrier supports GSM and will send a GSM card to you, this is a good phone to consider.",

            "comment": "After Three months I still love this phone. I was looking for something that would only do what I told it to, and nothing more. This guy comes with very little spamware and all that junk software that most devices are packed with. I got a free update to Android Lollipop and it runs fast, crisp, and clean on this junk free device. I got the Global GSM as I travel to Europe several times per year, but have not had use outside of US yet, so no word on that. My biggest worry was and is the non-replaceable battery. So far so good. I charge at night and run it all day. It only runs out during the day if I leave a program running on it that doesn't time out (candy crush) in my pocket for a few hours, and that's my fault. Otherwise, battery life seems good so far. Unless you NEED facetime, or some other apple software, there is no reason to buy a more expensive smart phone. If your getting an Android, get this one. Remember, Google OWNS Motorola. This is their phone, so Android rips on it. I bought a 32gb microSD and I have all the memory I could possibly need. google chrome flys through the net, I got hangouts dialer and I can make VOip calls from anywhere free.  so far, couldn't be happier.",

            "comment": "first of all. the battery life on this phone isn't terrible. but its under average. with wifi on. it will probably last you about 3-3.5 hours active. and it will still drain as much even if you don't use it with wifi on. however without wifi. its about 7-9 hours with usage. i will use it more and make sure how good is the battery. those are just rough estimates. but 2070 mah battery for a 5' phone is very frugal.performance. its not the fastest phone. but its very good for basic games and apps. I tried it on few of the really demanding racing games. and it worked. but not as well as better phones. a little choppy. you get what you pay for.build quality is top notch. its very solid. and very durable. it doesn't have any cool features. its a barebone smartphone that works welldoes not with a USB cable. or headphones. i don't understand why. don't need them anyway though.actually you might as well get the older model. i should have done that. it has the smaller screen. but the same battery so longer battery life. this model from the outside. is an upgrade but a downgrade otherwise.its good value.but nothing exceptional. the hardware on this phone is fairly old.",

            "comment": "Note- this is from the perspective of someone who has owned a first generation Moto G and a Nexus 5.I think this phone is great for anyone who needs a great smart phone but doesn't want to break the bank.  The speed of the phone is just as fast as the first gen Moto G while having a larger screen.  The speakers are really loud and sound good.  I haven't been able to update to Android 5.0 L yet, but I think there should be an update coming soon.  I also got this for a reasonable price, $150 when Amazon had the sale last week.  One minor problem I see is that the buttons do rattle a bit and feel slightly mushy in comparison to a Nexus 5.  I also think that the first gen Moto G was built slightly better, as the plastic back was molded better.Summary-Positives-- cheap phone, high end performance!- nice speakers- updates for the foreseeable future- large, crisp screen (but no increase in resolution)- Micro SD slotNegatives-- buttons rattle a bit- build quality slightly worse- bigger screen, but no bump in resolution- no 4G LTE, but you get what you pay forI recommend this phone to anyone who would like a cheap phone but with mid range specs!",

            "comment": "For the money, this phone is a steal. At the time I'm writing this, the Moto G model 2 is the best phone under $200. It multitasks well, plays games like a champ(once I get X-Com: Enemy Unknown I'll post its performance here), has front-facing stereo speakers and its screen is stunning. Pair this with a 64GB, class-10 micro-SD card for around $30 extra(format it or it won't work!) and you're set.I should note that even though sharpness and color accuracy are excellent, the Moto G(2)'s backlight bleeds a little when its screen is black. Normally it's impossible to notice, but when it goes completely black and you're using it with the lights off, it's a bit of a nuisance. If that's the one problem you're going to run into, this is clearly a very special phone.I bought this phone for myself, but now I'm recommending it to my friends, relatives and coworkers. Seeing their ears perk up when they hear it's only $180 is further confirmation that it's a spectacular value offering for people who can't afford the next big thing or don't wanna be on a contract.5/5, would buy again. WILL PROBABLY buy again, as a gift.",

Phone has latest Android 5, turn phone on not ONE thing of bloatware, and best part is, only came with one home screen (more can be added for your taste) which is perfect for me because I only need onePhone is lightning fast, camera is incredible (really only 8mp?), call quality is good, battery is about a day, and using pure android is how every phone should be.Motorola did a nice job on this and a phone I'll be keeping for a long time.My wife actually wants to get rid of her s4 for one of these, that's how surprising this phone is. She has a 13mp camera on hers, take same picture hold both phones side by side and you would think their both the same camera.Don't really think this phone is a replacement temporary phone like other people say, this is hands down better than the iPhone or any $700 phone. It does same exact things at the same performance for a quarter of the price.You would be stupid not to buy it",

Simply because I love keeping up to date. I have very expensive knowledge on about every android phone that is mainstream, and I have been an android user my entire cell phone life.The moto g is great phone, short and sweet. With a good screen, battery life and performance there's not much to dislike. The camera is very good, 8 mega pixels, and the screen really beings out those pictures. Although its only 720p the human eye can't really determine a difference. The performance is decent, its using a brand name CPU, and one of good quality, snapdragon 400. Battery life is decent. It will last me a hole day, from 7:30 am to 8pm with about 8% left. If I play games, and watch videos, and do very intensive things it burns through battery in 5-6 hours.Pros: good screen, good CPU, good battery, good camera.Con's: battery, no removable battery, back plate creeks slightly.Update: android lollipop update came the instant I turned the phone on.",

This one need the Consumer Cellular approved the update before it is available OTA. If you'd like to get the update as fast as possible. Buy the On-Site from Motorola. I was flashed the update and failed, even downgrade the firmware (need to unlocked the bootloader) still not working (Flash failed due to system app hash mismatch)But I was be able to get lollipop by flashing TWRP and restore from someone Lollipop backup. So if you're not power user and want to get the update asap this one might not on the fast track. But if you know what is fastboot, bootloader, root you may considered buying from Motorola.",

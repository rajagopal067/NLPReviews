            "comment": "I bought this phone fpr my wife.  She owned a BLU Life Play S.  After about a year it's starting to freeze up so I decieded to go with a more reputable comany like Motorola.  With all the positive views here on amazon I bought it off Ebay New (Open Box).  It worked great for a couple of weeks.  I own a used Samsung S4 (Red) and I didn't want my wife to have all the bloatwear so the Moto G 2nd Gen was it.  I love the phone itself.  No bloatwear, better battery life that my S4, lollipop is simple and smooth for my wife who is not a power user or very techie.  Screen was an upgrade and looked great dispite all the negative reviews, the lowest setting is dark but with it up a little there are no issues with clarity, it's a really good picture.  The front facing speakers sounded awesome.  Also despite all the negatives about the speaker volume, yes it's not the loudest, but understand that most phones don't need to be that loud and most of the time they give up quality for volume.  These sounded great and my wife listens to her phone every morning while getting ready.  The look and feel is pretty nice considering the price, curved back, the matte white is really nice, no finger prints like on my S4.  It's a little thick (11mm) for me, as for my wife not an issue.  Micro sd slot is always a must with me and was happy to see that they had it vs. their Moto X not having it.So let's talk about the negative and why I sent it back.  After about 2 weeks the phone went dead and my wife thought she had plenty of battery life.  I plugged it in and it said 0%.  While it was dark in the living room I noticed that the screen was backlit while charging which I thought was odd.  I unplugged it and tried to turn it on.  It flipped through the load screens and then when back to the black backlit screen. I tried volume up power and got to a factory reset screen and tried that, no luck, same result.  I got to send it back and get my money back.With all that said...  I really liked this phone I and I'm in the process of looking for another phone and would consider buying this new.  But, I'm so disapointed in the experiance and what really bothers me is the fact that I could take the battery out and reset the phone that way.  I like companies like Motorola, Samsung and BLU that make affordable phones for us Straight Talk or prepaid plan users.  This experiance didn't completely hate Motorola but it did deter me from buying from them for a while.  Remember is was a New (Other) or open box so their might have been issues underlying that phone.  So read the other reviews here and maybe this phone is for your.  I just wanted to note my experiances as hope to help.  I have reviews on the Samsung Mini SIII, BLU Life Play S, BLU Studio 5.0 LTE, BlU Studio Mini LTE, BLU Life 8 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 (Red) here on amazon.  This is a good phone for the price hopefully you will have better luck if you buy it new.",

However, if you know a little more than how to use it, look elsewhere.When I bought this, I though I could live with subpar specs.I bought this phone a few months ago.  The large screen is nice for netflix, the front facing speakers are strong, average, but much more convenient than back/side speakers, and the design of the phone is okay--the plastic on the back cover is very soft, so buy a case.The battery life gets worse, and quickly.  I may have just gotten a bad phone, but with 1200 mAh battery meant for it's predecessor which is significantly smaller, battery life is as expected.The camera is great for taking pictures of textbook pages, and wherever there is a lot of light.  This is a standard camera, but not completely horrible.  The screen and/or the camera is very dull.  Adjust saturation levels for normal looking colors.It does run stock android with a lollipop update right out of the box, which is nice as well.(I prefer stock android vs TouchWiz...)As with most Motorola products, it takes forever to start up, but the phone's processing power is average.  I have found it can have a surprising amount of webpages and apps open at a time, but I think the phone pauses the apps to it's best ability while in the background.Up until recently, the battery has been acting like an end-of-contract iPhone, and it has been over heating.  I have noticed 5-10% drops within the hour, just having cellular on (no data).  Getting full day battery means airplane mode and battery saver mode (a lollipop feature) when you use the phone on wifi or data.A competitor to this phone would be the LG G3 Vigor, as the battery life is 2450 mAh and removable, same screen size, better color, and has expandable memory as well.I do not recommend this phone if you want to use it at all.Important specs:NON removable batterysd card slot2 front facing speakers5 inch screen2 sim card slots",

            "comment": "This is a review based on the 2 days I've had this device.  I needed phone fast after I broke my HTC One M7.  Being stuck in a contract, and no discounts available, I needed the best discount phone I could find.  The Moto G 2nd Generation has not disappointed for the price.I bought the phone used, and it was considered in \"Very Good\" status because of supposed small scratches on the removable and replaceable back.  The phone actually came in \"Like New.\" No scratches whatsoever.  Just one of the many pleasant surprises I got from this phone!Battery Life: So far so good, easily lasts longer than my old M7.  By no means are you going to last all day if you are on it all day, but the \"experts\" have said they can get 4 hours on screen time before the battery dies.  Unless your watching movies and constantly on your phone, you'll be able to easily last the day, maybe even 2 days for some people.  So long battery saver apps that don't work anyway!Screen:  The 5 inch screen looks awesome.  For being 720p, I was worried I'd notice a huge difference.  It's the best 720p resolution phone I've seen.  The one problem is it doesn't get very bright to the point you can clearly see in direct sunlight.Design:  Great feel in the hand, very secure feeling.  That's something I needed to compensate on the M7 as the aluminum build was very slippery.  The dual screen stereo speakers are a nice touch, not the greatest out there, but certainly better than most phones with the volume in one spot on the back of the phone.Software:  Pretty much Stock Android, no bloatware, the way Android was meant to be!  Thank you Motorola! Sometimes I notice it takes about 3 seconds for the home screen to load back up after exiting certain apps.  Nothing serious by any means, but you will notice the processor is a little slower than flagship devices (that is to be expected).  Works pretty well given it only has 1GB of RAM.  Just be sure to close out the apps you don't need to reduce chances of slowdowns.Network:  3G with the Global Version on AT&T, that's kind up a bummer, but saves a ton of battery life.  Luckily, I have Wifi at Home and Work, plus all the public places where there is free Wifi.  Otherwise, the 3G network is suitable, although noticeably slower than LTE.  I do have to say the Wifi on this phone extends much further on this phone than my M7, so I was extremely happy about that!Camera:  Not an expert on the camera. From professional reviews, there are better cameras out there, but to me it seems good enough for me, who rarely takes many photos.  For a discount phone, though, I highly doubt you'll find a better camera.Storage:  At 8GB (about 4.5-5GB usable for the user), you may need to get a micro SD card, I got one that's 32GB on Amazon for about $16.  Some apps allow you to store on the SD card, some don't.  At some point, you may need to decide which apps are worth keeping and which are not because of that issue if they don't all write to your SD Card.Also has an FM Radio Tuner!!!!To sum this review up, I have been pleasantly surprised about all the great things about this phone.  It does virtually everything very well.  I bought it as a replacement phone until my contract is ready for a new flagship device, but so far this may be my phone of choice for a while!",

            "comment": "All around, it is a good phone. I previously have had a Lumia 800, Lumia 521, and now I have a Moto G (US GSM version). My advice is to immediately buy the Samsung Evo class 10 32GB microSD card because the storage is pretty small and imho, I don't trust sandisk for heavy use since their cards tend to die on me. This seems like an added expense but 8GB goes *really* fast so you'll want to move your apps to the microSD card so that you can actually use the phone. That being said, with a microSD Card, the small storage DOES NOT ruin the phone. This phone works fabulously. It's relatively fast, it's build quality is the highest i've ever seen in this price bracket, the screen pixels are visible at some angles but its never too bad, it's only an annoyance if you are *very* picky. The phone comes with almost stock android and shortly after opening it, my phone received the upgrade to Lollipop.  One grievance is that this phone uses an ARMv7 processor and therefore lacks hardware level encryption support so if you encrypt this phone, you'll take a performance penalty. Also another drawback to this phone is that it lacks NFC and that makes me doubt the availability of fourthcoming features in the android operating such as Android Pay for this particular phone. All in all, I would buy this phone again because quite frankly, you can't beat the price that this phone is selling for and once you consider what you get for the price, it's one hell of a deal. I would recommend buying the extended warranty from Lenovo/Motorola (Lenovo owns Motorola) as it is by far the cheapest extended warranty you can buy and includes accident damage coverage. You have 30 days (if my memory serves correct) after date of purchase to buy the warranty through the motorola website.TLDR: decent phone at a price too good to pass up, just remember a microSD Card.",

It is still performing as expected...no lag or freezing of any kind despite its aged processor. A bug fix is being sent via OTA soon because of slight battery drain and a glitch that involves a blank but consistent Google Play Music notification in the status bar. The only way to get rid of it is to kill the app, reopen it, then kill it a second time. Should be fixed soon though.The screen is still crisp but its IPS display does not perform as well in bright outdoor light. For a budget phone, it's an amazing display. The gorilla glass is also scratch and smudge resistant but you should still invest in a protector to be safe. The body is not much bigger than the screen and, like its Moto Family, sports a curved backing to fit perfectly in your palm.There is no issue with gaming or multitasking. The camera is 8 MP on the back and 2 MP on the front. I was surprised at the quality of the front-facing, or \"selfie,\" camera. It's quality isn't far away from its 8 MP counterpart. Call quality is great on both ends, which I tested with a few calls. The physical speakers play sound adequately enough; perfect for videos and music for yourself but not enough to fill a room.Despite a few small setbacks here and there, you still get a 5\" display with formidable specs and the latest Android OS. Also: downloading Clean Master will really help your performance. It clears RAM usage every time the phone is unlocked and keeps it running very smoothly.",

            "comment": "review for smart phone motorola Moto G 2nd generation - about $179only have it for 2 days. the size is a funny thing - if you use it as navi system in the car or for picture viewing you want a big screen - if for phone usage or to put it in the pocket it should be smaller. it feels fairly slipper and i always fear that i will drop it. would be nice to have nicer grip feeling. so no clear judgment here but i would prefer a smaller size.screen is good - also visible in sunny environment.I was trying to define some speed dialing numbers and had google for help -over I think very usable and the price is unbeatable.now some trouble. The 'location' feature to only use GPS  never got any satellite signal - tried several GPS apps - no success. googled it and found that many people had similar issues and some recommendation went so far as to send it back as 'defective' or root the device (software experts again) .I cannot blame the people. but here my simple solution until the software is fixed- as usual - software bug. if you ENABLE all 'location' features (web, cell signal and GPS) it works - with normal GPS reception. not sure why software developers can miss that one but then we know they are also only human even they believe they are closer to super human.camera is nice but lens location seems awkward - I tend to cover the lens with the left finger if I use it as it would be convenient.HDR feature shows improved quality.I use a prepaid data plan (H20 - h2owireless.com-had to perform manual setup to get to the internet- balance stays for 90 days which is better than 30 days from many other provides) and therefore I am observant of the usage. it seems the phone reasonably toggles to wifi as soon it is in proximity.there is a data transfer monitoring feature in this OS but I have not figured out how good the information actually  is.I could setup the phone in my car (fiat 500e) with Bluetooth and it works fine for phone usage. I have not figures out how to play the audio (music) through Bluetooth.battery life with GPS wifi Bluetooth and internet browsing including listening to internet radio seems ok for 1 day).overall very responsive behavior -it uses microSIM card which is not a big deal in general because the card is only different in the plastic around the contacts - so you can cut away the plastic carefully and make it work- I was lucky that my nearby T-Mobile store had a little cutter tool and they cut my card from SIM to microSIM for free. just keep remaining part of the cutout and you and still use the microSIM with this part together when SIM is needed. btw the same works for nanoSIM.I found some reviews complaining over the FM radio. no complains here it worked fine and picked up weak stations same way as all my other dedicated FM radios. some problems may be related to the length of the headphone cables which acts as antenna. so easiest way to check if reception is poor to try an other headphone cable.it only takes one SIM. also nice that it has a microSD slot.disadvantage is that both slots are only accessible when back cover removed and removing the back cover can be somewhat tricky.I wish it had a replaceable battery so one could easily swap out but no batter is built-in.android 4.4.4 seems ok but certain things are not really intuitive (ups - am I complaining again about software :) )I will update how it behaves after dropping it on the ground and after accidently dropping it in water - ha ha.I also booked a flight to the space station and will report on its behavior in zero gravity.",

            "comment": "Good budget phone running stock android.  The most impressive thing about the phone is it's hardware.  It has front facing speakers and it's build quality is pretty good as well.  IMO, this is the perfect size for a smartphone.  It's not too big and bulky but it's not small either.  Stock android is also a plus.  The phone only has 1 gb of ram, but it only uses about 500 mb because it's running on stock android.  It also has expandable memory.  The camera on this phone is good for the price, but bad compared to high end phones.  As for the weaknesses of the phone, it's running stock android (this is also a strength because of stock android minimalist design).  I'm not a fan of google's photo viewer or google's music player so I ended up having to download a 3rd party photo viewer and music player which isn't as good as Samsung's.  A lot of people are a fan of google play music, but I'm not.  I'm not a fan of google's photo viewer either because I can't tell which photos are on my sd card and which photos are on the phone.  I also can't transfer photos from the phone to the sd card using the google photo viewer (something that I was able to do on a Samsung).  The other weakness of this phone is that it doesn't have 4g LTE.  It's not a big deal because HSPA+ is fast as well but it's something that's worth mentioning.  Contrary to popular belief, I think you could find a phone that's as good as this for around the same price.  It probably won't be running stock android, but I really don't care about that anymore tbh.  Off the top of my head I could name 3 phones that I've owned that are better than this and also in the same price range as this: Optimus L90, Galaxy Avant, and the ZTE Zmax.",

            "comment": "I picked 3 stars only because as my mouse pointer hovered over it, out popped \"It's okay.\" That's pretty much my feeling about this phone. Don't get me wrong, it's a good phone, but I didn't get any wow factor from it.ATT is my provider and I had a S3 until it met it's end in a liquid accident. I could not go a day without a phone for work so I pried my son's WP (Windows Phone) from his fingers. He had a inexpensive Nokia 635, which was his replacement after he trashed his phone. I use my cell to check email, make the occasional call, get directions, occasional mobile banking, and texting. That's it, not a heavy user at all. So for those limited activities I give Moto G 3 stars.Moto G is a decent phone no doubt about it but IMO it's over priced by about 50 bucks. Maybe my opinion will change when Lollipop gets released next week, but after having Cortana for 2 weeks, Goggle Now doesn't cut it for me. I'm in my car, a 2015 Elantra, quite a bit and bluetooth with the Moto is iffy sometimes. Volume, call quality, etc... Battery life is so-so even with battery saver turned on. I'm just not impressed. I'm thinking I could have saved a few bucks and gone with BLU or waited for the new Samsung to come out.The WP with Cortana worked flawlessly with Bluetooth in my car. It was my first experience with a cell phone wow factor. It would automatically pair every time without fail or incident. And the kicker, it would interrupt my music or whatever I was listening to on the radio on on XM to tell me I had a call or a text and give me the option to respond or ignore. It would also cut in on my radio listening when I was using navigation mode. Now perhaps there is a way to get an android phone to do this without having to switch my cars audio system constantly to media mode, but I don't think so.Of course if you like access to tons of apps, the android phone or an iphone is the phone for you. This Moto G is every bit as good as my S3, and of course way less expensive. If you're looking for a good hands free experience, it pains me to say but a cheap WP at half the cost of Moto G might be a better choice for you. Anyway, just my opinion.",

Didn't know anything about the newer moto phones as I hadnt seen one in forever- until I noticed a classmate using one. So I found them here. I went back and fourth between the E,G and X and read all of the tech reviews. I loved the price of the G since I was looking for something really cheap and liked the look of the customizable model X. I settled on the G because it was newer than the G and has a larger screen.Its a good, very basic phone. Dont expect any bells or whistles. As a former iPhone user, its definitely a huge step down. But if you are looking for a good value I recommend it.As cheap as it is, it doesnt look or feel cheap. Love the screen quality and the subtle matte white casing  (which the guy at t-mobile admired). Speed is ok, a little slow. I will have to to get an SD card.Do note that this takes a micro sim from t-mobile. I had to swing by and buy one to use this phone.Battery life is excellent- almost as good as my iPhone was but much, much better than the Galaxy. Lasts over 24 hours.I wont go into the specs because youve probably read all of those reviews.This is a basic, handsome phone that is well worth the small price tag. Id do it again but would pay attention to the warnings about how basic it is.Amazon was ( and still is) sold out so I bought mine straight from Motorola- which I hated to do.It arrived to me from Hong Kong in 2 days once it finally shipped. I would have preferred to buy it from Amazon if Id had the choice.",

Apart from this phone, all other unlocked android (kitkat or L) phones were more than double as expensive. I already purchased and returned \"Blu Life One\" few months earlier due to some issues with the phone. But, this Moto G 2nd Gen seems to be working fine till now. Recently, it has been upgraded to Android Lollipop also. There may be some shortcomings for some people e.g. No 4G LTE, but HSPA+ works fine for me. I have global GSM version, so check 3G and HSPA+ frequency of your provider before buying. Camera is nice, takes good quality pictures. Although not full HD 1080p, but only 720p for movies. No predefined picture modes either. Front camera is average. Another thing which could be troublesome is only 8GB internal memory out of which Android itself take more than half probably. As of now, no issues but over the time as android and other apps gets updated this memory may prove less. In India, same phone comes with 16GB internal memory. Dont know why they can't have 16GB model option here in US. Does not comes with headphone or screenguard or cover, so you have to get those separately. Sometimes I feel that when I talk putting the phone on left ear the voice is feable as compared to right ear, but that could just be my ears, although I never felt that effect with any other phones. Battery lasts 24-48 hrs for me, I mostly use it for checking emails, news, some videos, pandora (overall 1.5-2 hrs) and very few phone calls and messages. Hope this helps !!",

This phone did not disappoint me. I got the phone, stuck my SIM card from the iPhone in it, and was working immediately. Data setup was a little additional trouble, but not much. Just some settings from my wireless carrier's web site.My user profile:I don't yack on the phone like some, and discipline my internet habits, so I use Black Wireless pay as you go which costs $0.05/minute voice and text, and $0.10/MB data. My cell usage rarely exceeds $5.00/month. So, it's like a small tablet with emergency internet and phone when needed.The screen is larger than the 3GS, battery life longer and I'm no longer in the Apple ecosystem (but went into the Google system.) The system is 3G-only, but being a pay as you go ($.10/MB data) that's a benefit, since it's easier to keep track of data usage when it doesn't roar thru as fast. I turn it on when I really need the internet and am away from WiFi, then turn it off. I use OSMAND (which is not even available for the iPhone) maps which unlike Google maps allows me to navigate while off-line.  Anyway, who really needs 4G speed on a phone?I got a 32 GB memory card and now have around 40 GB total, for an additional $19.00. Apple charges lots more for built-in memory.GPS works well. Fast first fix, holds on well.Great buy, in my opinion. I'd do it again and recommend it to others.",

            "comment": "I've owned a few different smart phones, iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, Galaxy S3, and an old model of the Galaxy Ace. I prefer the Samsung phones to the Apple phones, most notably because of the ability to handle music file transfers using MTP.The Moto G, similar to the Galaxy Ace I previously owned, came with no discernible manufacture branded bloatware. There are some Motorola branded settings and apps, but they aren't cluttering the app list, and they aren't attempting to manipulate me into using them. There are some other apps that are useless to me, but these things are intrinsic to Android, and I won't fault the phone for that. As an aside, one major disappointment for me with the latest version of android was the removal of the Music Player app, leaving the excessive Play Music as the only default option as a music player. However, I've found Rocket Player to be a great substitute.My use for a smart phone is very limited, and my aesthetic desires lean toward utilitarian minimalism & simplicity. My performance expectations are for solid build quality, dependability, and processing speed that doesn't distract from the simple tasks I perform. I don't play mobile games, nor do I watch many videos, do any social networking, or any intense mobile phone usage. I make few phone calls (often less than 1-5 hours per week), and limit texting to family and close friends. I have not plugged this phone in to charge within the past 3 days, and the battery currently reads 30%. The biggest usage that this phone gets from me is as a Bluetooth music player in the car. It performs as expected, and with a 32GB micro-SD card, I don't have to worry too much about micromanaging what music I transfer to the phone, which I do via drag & drop through Windows Explorer, similar to old USB mass storage devices. There's no requirement for invasive or bloated proprietary software to handle media files.The phone is thin and feels solidly built. It may be inexpensive, but it does not appear to be, nor does it feel cheap. The screen looks decent, the camera takes pictures, the speakers make noise, and the phone has a reassuring heft. The appearance is simple and clean, the slight curve to the back gives a bit of subtle personality, but doesn't have the appearance of forced style. The Motorola logo is small and minimal, with no other unnecessary markings or text shown on the phone. The back cover of the phone I ordered is a matte black color with a rubbery texture that feels reassuringly grippy. I did read the specifications before purchasing, but I was not prepared for how large the screen is in my hand. It was a pleasant surprise.Barring any catastrophic failures, this is easily the preferred phone that I have owned. From what I can tell, the Moto G isn't selling any gimmicks. I feel like this phone addresses all of my needs without forcing me to compromise by accepting superfluous features or inducting me into some culture of gadget-hunger satisfying consumerism.",

            "comment": "Yes, if you compare it to flagships, which are 4-6 times pricier unlocked, you will find differences and areas where moto g 2014 lags. But do yourself a favor and do not compare moto g to those phones. This phone is NOT meant to be brand's flagship. This is absolutely the best valued phone on the market. If you judge the phone simply by specs and numbers, it is not impressive at all. However, once you get to use it, moto g will amaze you what it does for less than 200$ contract free !!!! If you \"need\" galaxy S5, HTC M8, or iPhone 6+, go buy those instead but don't complain that moto g doesn't have the features of +500$ phones.Things I personally like:+not much bloatware and the little that is there is dealt with quite easily: settings-> Apps -> find the app 'google play books, talkback, google keyboard hindi input, ...etc' -> disable and turn off notifications. No need to root the phone and void the warranty.+ 300 per inch pixel density is plentiful. From the distance a person looks at the phone screen, human eye doesn't even resolve the different pixel resolutions (in this range and above). The screen is not too big and not too small, with sharp colors. I prefer this size over the original moto g. Especially the weather widgets, typing and emails are easier to read when compared to moto g 1st gen. But I have to admit that 1st gen feels more natural in my small hands.+ Battery life: I am not a heavy user/gamer nor phone addict. I turn GPS on only when I need it. I don't use moto assist, Google now and others that want to continuously access my location and tell me that I arrived home. I use moto battery saver, and turn off Wi-Fi, mobile data, and SYNCHRONIZATION during times I am not needing it. There is great power toggle app called CONTROL CENTER which allows you to turn ON/OFF these setting with one click from the home screen and much more.Phone battery goes down by 1% over 10 hour night when set to airplane mode. It uses little over 1% of battery's capacity per hour with SYNC+WiFi ON and mobile data+gps off. On easy day use with about 20 mins of calling, 40 texts, 10 emails, some calendar activity, and 0.5 hour of browsing the internet, battery is at 70% after 8hr long day, which allows me to go 2 full days without charging.+Call quality is very good, even for international calls. Both the internal and the external speakers are loud enough with good fidelity throughout all volume levels.Things I dislike:-nothing. I realize there is budget limitation and with the price being so low for UNLOCKED phone, this is truly an amazing deal. I would rather buy this phone again with same specs and features for the same price, for 150$ on special sale, rather than getting more bang with increased price.Things I would welcome in next generation:***RAM could use an upgrade as I am running with 1GB RAM at 65% with my stock setup.***I would welcome more size options for photos. Currently there are only two available 4:3 and 16:9 (8 MP and 6 MP). Larger photos eat up storage space quicker and takes longer for uploading,sharing especially when there is no need and use for such large files. For poster-sized pictures, I would use real camera with LARGE sensor and LARGE lens. Optical resolution is not improved by simply adding pixels to an image, but somehow pixel density gets buyer's attention.***Removable battery if engineering and design are permitting.",

I live in a rural area (lots of farming fields), but get a very strong signal, and before, that was a problem in this area. Although this phone is only a 3G & not a 4G LTE, it's still plenty fast enough for me.The build quality of this phone is also excellent, and very easy to install my Sim Card, and an extra 32Mb micro SDHC card, I chose the\u00a0SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB. It's very affordable, and one of the fastest SDHC cards made. Plus I've been using SanDisk storage cards of all kinds, for many many years, and have never been let down.This phone has a good weight to it, without being to heavy to handle. Very solid phone build!I've always liked Motorola & Samsung, for good quality cell phones.This one does not disappoint at all. Absolutely Zero buyers remorse!The features on this Moto G 2nd Gen are wide ranging and many.As this is my first smart phone, I found it easy enough to set up, and have been learning how to do things each day. The ability to connect to my Wi-Fi network really makes it easy on my phone plan, (I use Consumer Cellular). So while at home, all of my calls, data, and messaging, are unlimited, and all free, through my Wi-Fi.The phone plan usage takes affect only when I use it on the road. So it's very economical for me!When I turn it on, it automatically seeks out and connects to my Wi-Fi network, and when I leave the house, it automatically switches to the cell towers.This smart phone is basically a hand held computer, and very fast in my opinion, (again, never had a phone with a quad core processor in it).The battery life is just Ok, but when I stop playing with it, I'm sure it will last me far longer.This phone does everything I need, and much much more!This is a great smart phone at a great price.So for what it's worth, I'd highly recommend this phone.Update (12/13/2014)Man, I tell ya, the more I use this Moto G 2nd Gen, the more I Love it!!!This thing really is a handheld computer, and there's just so many very useful Apps, it's unbelievable.I also very highly recommend getting this Holster:Fosmon Shock Absorbing, Hybrid Holster Cover and Case, for Motorola Moto G (2nd Generation, 2014)I did a lot of searching for a good holster, for my new Moto G 2nd Gen Smart Phone, and it had to have good protection, without breaking the Bank!This Case/Cover Holster is all that and more!I was just amazed at how nice this Holster is for the incredibly low price.It provides Excellent protection for my phone.Take a look at it, and it comes in different colors, other than Black.I think it's an excellent holster for the Moto G 2nd Gen!!!If your looking for a great protective case, rather than a holster, I first bought this one:LK  - Rugged Armor SpiderIt's an excellent case for this Moto G 2nd Gen!It also provides a high level of protection, with excellent materials, and great cushioning.",

I was worried about performance and the camera.  I had a short stint with a Nexus One that left me with a bit of a sour taste for Android so this was a big leap.The phone is fast, the only thing that seems to make it hang a bit are large web pages, jumping back to the home screen can take 1-2 seconds, but everything else seems as fast or faster than my iphone 5 with 7.1.2.  Battery life is just as good as the iphone.The screen is amazing and the biggest surprise is the camera, the daytime photos are fantastic.  Nighttime are slightly worse than the iphone but the day shots are just that much better.Overall a fantastic phone and a pleasure to use.  This is one of those devices that is greater than the sum of its parts (or specs).",

I personally think 4.5-4.7\" is perfect, but most people tend to disagree with me seeing all flagships nowadays are 5\"+. The camera is a huge improvement over the original moto g and the front facing speakers are also a really nice touch. The back is a really nice rubberized finish. I was not a fan of the original moto g's back finish but it seems like motorola has taken that into account and fixed it on the second generation. The phone is just as quick and snappy as the first gen. The one thing I would have liked to see is a version with LTE that costs a little bit more. I am sure they will release one just like they did with the original G but I would have liked to see that as an option on release. Overall, this is an amazing phone at an even more amazing price. If you are looking for a sub-$200 smartphone, this is one you should highly consider.",

But it was a three year old phone and even the custom support had become  non-existent. Kit-Kat was out of the question since all of the versions available were only for the 8800-pro or 8800.  I flip-flopped on whether to buy this phone or the previous generation with 16 gig. This one won out for three reasons:1. Micro SD Card capability2. The 5\" screen.3. Kit-KatOverall, I am extremely pleased. I received the phone yesterday and after a 5 minute phone call to our carrier Consumer Cellular, it was up and running. Within a couple of hours I had all of my apps and data loaded, and everything fine-tuned just the way I like it. The large screen is great and it weighs less than the Huawei. It runs circles around it as well.I highly recommend this phone based on my initial impressions but I will update periodically as I put more use on it.UPDATE 10/10/2014 - Well, after a week of use I am even more pleased than I was initially.Battery life - I have used it as a wireless access point for my tablet several times in the past week. When used this way, the battery on my old phone would run down to less than 20% within three hours. But the Moto G still had 63% after using it as an access point for 6 hours. And during normal usage I am good for a couple of days, though I charge it every evening just out of habit.Performance - When compared to my previous phone, it is kind of like going from a Volkswagen beetle to a Ferrari. Need I say more?Usability - The larger screen makes a world of difference for me. I don't have large fingers but I am fumble fingered when it comes to texting, or selecting items. But with this phone I have considerably fewer problems doing both. And I love the Kit-Kat interface. Both my wife and I have tablets that run Kit-Kat based ROM's so we are familiar with the look and feel. The slim lightweight design is nice as well though I do sometimes feel like it will slip out of my hand easily if I am not very careful. I am looking for a case that will provide a better grip without adding a lot of bulk.UPDATE 1/19/2015 - After over 3 months of usage I can say I am more convinced than ever that I chose the right phone. Since my last update I have installed a Lollipop 5.0.2 based custom ROM. It runs more smoothly and performance is even better than before. Battery life, although good before is even better now. My daughter bought me a nice case for it for Christmas an grip is much better. I was at lunch today with my brother-in-law who is an iPhone, AT&T fan-boy and an Android hater. We both started to look up info at the same time and I had it on my screen in less than half the time he did. This is the norm whenever we are together. It runs circles around his Crapple iPhone 5.If you want a decent smartphone without paying a small fortune for it go for this phone. You cannot beat it for the price and performance.",

Was looking for a phone with good quality speakers, and this phone has them in stereo sound (two independent audio channels).  I also like the 5-inch screen - for me the phone has a perfect form factor, both thin and lightweight.  The camera and battery-life are good, and the responsiveness of the user interface on the phone is on par with my wife's Nexus 5 (which cost $359). The haptic touch typing is really good (makes typing a better experience given my fat fingers).Another bonus is that the Android experience is native Google Android with no bloat-ware, with an upgrade when the next version becomes available.Update 9-30-2014:After over a week of use:  Discovered battery life is only so-so -- screen uses a lot of juice.  To extend battery life, screen must be dimmed, and running apps stopped, otherwise by end-of-day, battery will need to be charged.",

Well, I found a perfect phone for me. This phone is not a Nexus 5 and so I won't try to kid you into a comparison. I really use my smartphones, but I don't game with them, so I know I needed a decent performer with decent specs. I originally bought the Moto G 4.5\" 2013 and love it, but the screen was just not big enough for me, so I got this one. The phone is actually a robust unit, with everything that I needed. The quad core processor powers it just fine and runs all my apps (Again, I am not stressing it by gaming or anything like that). The screen is very crisp and vibrant, which pleasantly surprised me for a 720p screen that was stretch from the 4.5\" model. I don't see pixelation like I thought. The 3G (4G technically) speeds are just fine with it's HSPA+ 21mpbs rating, I am cruising through the web just fine on Cricket wireless. LTE might better, but I don't notice because the speeds that I get are the same as I was getting with LTE. The camera is an 8mp shooter which is a disappointment but I can live with it. The MicroSD slot is a great addition to this phone and I am using a 64gb Samsung Evo card, even though it says 32gb max. Lastly, it is a very desireable shape, and the weight is a tad more than others in this range, but it's ok, and for $180 it just can't be beat. I gave it 4 stars, because of the camera, but wanted to give it 4.75! And the best of all... this phone is getting the Android 5 update first before any other phone... WOW!",

I have never had a cell phone simply because I don't really call a lot of people and most of the time I'm either at work or at home.  It only took a few days for me figure out how to set this up to be a very useful device.  I've found that using things like google dialer and google keep have really made this phone worth having.  I've found wifi to be available and open at hospitals and walmart and work and church so really other than when I'm driving there is very little time I'm not able to use the phone.  Plus if there was an emergency the phone will still work to dial 911 which is a great safety feature.  I use the google keep to have an ongoing grocery list that we share and is constantly updated.  The phone also works with our new Amazon Echo.  I have tied it into all my email accounts including work so very little gets past me now without a reminder.  The phone its self works great, looks good, and I have had very few issues with it.  The camera takes good pictures and video.  The kindle app functions great, and I get my sports scores and the weather, occasionally watch videos and listen to music.

At the beginning the system is very responsive and I was pretty happy with the device but after months of use it became slower and slower. The system began to lag badly and even freeze out for couple of seconds while I was switching between apps too fast or running large apps like Google Map. The installing of Google Now Launcher makes things worse (but it's really a useful app IMO). After upgrade to Android 5.0, the experience starts to become unbearable.Meanwhile when I try to install new apps, I was told 'There is insufficient storage on the device blah blah blah'. I tried to move most of the apps to the SD card, it solved the problem for a short while, and then I experience that error again.I figured there must be something wrong because the operating system can use up the whole 8G storage by no means, so I went to SETTINGS --> STORAGE. After letting the system to calculate the usage, it turned out that 'Cached data' and 'Misc' eat up 2G of the storage which is pretty crazy. I tried to empty both of them out without a second thought and go back to the home screen. Guess what, the system was almost as smooth as the first day I purchased the phone !It's been a week since I wiped out those cache data and the system still running fine.",

It's surprisingly thin and durable without a case. However the plastic backing makes it feel kind of cheap.What I really love about this phone are the notification settings, improved with Android Lollipop.1. The nifty option to have screen wake for general notifications and notification snippets on the lock screen. This feature is new to Android 5. I like these options simply because they mimic what an IPhone does upon receiving a notification.2. The built in LED notification light. This feature seems to be less and less common on new phones. I love the light because I don't always check my phone immediately after hearing it ring/ vibrate and I can forget if I'm not reminded. If you constant check your phone then this probably doesn't matter.Also, with Android 5 there are a lot of new apps that boosts the functionality of this phone. For example, the phone camera is pretty good but adding google camera from the playstore adds a bunch of cool features.Overall, if you're used to Android this phone won't knock your socks off and it's nothing fancy to look at but it does gain a considerable edge with Android 5 and is a reliable phone.",

I think the overall quality is pretty good.  I added a 64GB card to the phone and it sees all of the card (not just 32GB).  I do not notice much delay in apps.  Even large apps like Mickey Castle of Illusion and DragonVale run just fine.  The camera is good.  At least it is not worse than T989s camera, maybe even better in darker settings due to HDR on Moto G2.  I have added Fosmon branded case and screen protector, and both seem good.A couple of things I didn't like:  1. The phone's body extends a little above the glass and creates a sharp edge, which felt uncomfortable against the ear.  The protective case I added solved this by covering the edge.  2. There is a gap around speakers.  Dust and lint collects there.  So I have to clean at least once a week with a corner of a sticky note.  However, I enjoy the front facing speakers more than I am annoyed by having to clean the gap around them.Overall, I am happy with the phone for the price.",

I bought this phone for my daughter to replace her Nokia Windows phone - hey, she likes to be different! I am really impressed with the new screen, both in terms of size and clarity. Owning a phone with a 1080p screen, I can say that I would have no problem moving back down to the 720p screen of the Moto G - it is good enough for me. Performance-wise I've found the 2nd Gen Moto G to be comparable to my Nexus 4, which was no slouch. The stereo speakers put out crisp clear sound, which puts my Nexus 5 to shame.If only the phone came with more storage for apps - 8 gigabytes is OK if you don't install too many apps. You can always put your music and videos on a micro SD card, since the phone provides support for it. If the 2nd Gen Moto G came with 16Gb of storage for apps I would say it was the perfect budget phone. Having the SD slot makes it perfect for my daughter as she can put all of her music on there and not impact the storage space for apps.The 2nd Gen Moto G doesn't support LTE, but does have support for HSPA+ 21 networks, meaning web browsing is pretty snappy. We use the phone with T Mobile, and the speeds around the Sacramento region where I live are pretty fast.If you can live with the amount of provided storage (currently 8Gb) for apps then this phone should definitely be on your short list for best sub $200 smartphone...",

And is not pre-loaded with any extra junky apps from carriers.All of the google apps work just fine, it is faster than my old phone (an older Samsung), and it has a 5-inch screen which is quite roomy. With light use I go 2 days without looking for a charger, and with more heavy use (music streaming, YouTube, etc.) battery life still lasts all day long.I couple of times during my commute (1-hour bus trip) my phone froze up, but I think that was due to trying to stream audio/video while the bus went in and out of coverage areas. Anyway, this behavior didn't really surprise me and I would expect that on other phones.If there is ONE drawback that I see with the phone, it is that the camera is slow or finicky to focus. I am getting better at using it, at first many photos I took were slightly blurred. But the camera is still OK, and I take plenty of pictures with it, it was just a stumbling block at first. Undoubtedly the $600 phones have better cameras or focusing logic, but I'm not willing to shell out that much for a slightly better camera.For what I'm getting and for the price I paid, I think this is the best deal going. Highly recommended.",

First i would rate the hardware as 4 since this is the best phone for 179 $ you can get as of right now, this phone has a beautiful design, and with it's 5 inch 720p screen you cant go wrong. Browsing and reading web pages looks sharp, and the videos looks sharp as well. The rear camera is good and taking pictures is fun with this phone but do not expect something close to high end smarthphone. The front camera quality is not as good and i wouldn't recommended it for selfies, it is only useful for video chatting when needed.The speakers are good qnd  loud enough to listen to music or talk in speaker phone mode.Multitasking is not smooth specialy when using this phone with the extremely buggy lolipop 5.0.2 and only 1 giga of ram, and it can be really frustrating when opening apps, and the phone start lagging and freezing if you dont reboot your phone once a day.The processor is fast enought to open webpages, play regular games, opening apps.Thia my rating to every part of the phoneScreen  4 starsSpeakers.  4 starsFront camera.  2 starsRear camera.  3 starsProcessor.  4 starsDesign.  4 starsOperating system ( lolipop 5.0.2)  2 StarsStarsI hope that this review is helpful to everyone.UPDATE:  it have been 8 month since i bought thw phone running a bugy version of lolipop (5.0.2) and the phone didnt receive an update to lolipop 5.1or 5.1.1 which google released in march. Motorola seems to just not care at all about the custumers who puchased the moto G 2014 or 2013NOTE: The new moto g 2015 was released with thw newest 5.1.1 out of the box taking in considiration  the moto G have similar specs.",

As soon as it was received and charged, powered it on and was greeted with the \"Update\" option to Loli 5.0.2 already ready to go! A great sign already. Then, loaded up many apps, turned off and uninstalled some unneeded services, put Nova Prime launcher on it and BAM! This phone really does have some kick for a \"low\" end phone. I will have many apps running at the same time, streaming music over Bluetooth and it doesn't even stutter. Which a far better experience than I have had with Android years back. Got to say this phone and Motorola has really done a great job and very happy I switched to it! And oh, great battery life as well!Some minor things that would made this phone really great would have been 4G LTE but I was really surprised how good standard 4G really works good. Just if I download an app, it will take a little longer than on 4G LTE but everything else is smooth. The other thing is the only 8GB storage on the phone. Yes, you can offload many apps on to the SD card, which is great. BUT, the apps still have to have some data on the main storage and so, it will start to fill up faster than you think. Out of all the things I could say, that would be the main issue (though really small) that I would address. Still a great phone for a good price if you want a wonderful Android experience!",

This seemed to fit the bill, in most respects. There were some issues I had with this phone after buying it... 1) I had to get someone stronger to get the back off of it for me to load the cards because it was so tight, which I suppose would be a good thing since I think it's waterproof to a small degree.2) I couldn't just pull down and toggle Bluetooth/wireless/airplane mode, etc at will, but would have to go into settings to do this.3)I rarely use a cell phone since I live in a very rural area with bluffs all around, so cell signals are quite spotty, and I would expect the battery to last much longer, however I do have several apps installed, so that may be the culprit.4) When placing a call, I have to push the dialpad icon before I can call someone, even someone I have already selected. It does not default to a dialpad, but you have to manually select the dialpad, as if it wanted me to mainly  go to speed dial and pictures, which I really don't want to be fored to do. \\All in all, it's a decent phone, and it's at an extremely good price point, is pretty snappy, and takes much better pics than my pantech,which was an issue with the pantech, albeit pretty much the only issue until the pantech died on me.",

The thing that I like most about this is that I can use the GPS almost all day without running out the battery very much. Almost every other phone will really quickly drain the battery. And, speaking of the GPS on this phone, it connects instantly. I can have this phone idle for hours, and then I fire up Google maps, and it instantly knows exactly where I am. I know that there are a ton of other great features about this phone, but I love the GPS the best.The screen is nice and big, but it's not too big. It's really the perfect size. It's really responsive, too. The screen is crisp and clear, and it totally blows away the screens of other budget phones. It switches really fast between applications, and it has been able to run everything that I've thrown at it so far.The only bad thing is that as of today, it's still stuck on Android 5.0.2. I wish they'd update it to 5.1, because I think that would be a little better, but so far they haven't. But, it works really well on Android Lollipop. You do have to download the update, because it comes prepackaged with Android 4.4, but it's really easy and smooth. I didn't lose any data at all with the upgrade.",

I did some research on unlocked android phones and the reviews for this phone are very, very impressive. Basically the reviews (PCMag, PCWorld, CNET, etc.) all agree that this is one of the best budget android phones you can buy, if not THE best. As you can tell from the above, the only thing we're qualified to claim is that this phone is fantastically better than any flip phone we're ever had. The sound quality (via Ting Wireless) ranges from very, very good to excellent. I detected a slight hollowness to  the sound of one call I made to a family member but for every other call we've made the sound quality has been excellent. We're new to android so I don't know if this basically \"plain\" version is better or worse than other versions, only that it's pretty easy to figure out how to make a call but everything else has a learning curve. The help system includes text and how-to videos, so learning isn't all that much of a chore. I'll be getting a 2nd one for myself is the near future. This phone really exceeded our expectations. We recommend this phone without reservation, though keep in mind we're new to this type of phone and have had it only for a couple of days.",

When I was comparing and shopping around, I knew that I didn't really want to spend more than $200 on a phone--and this was it! I'm not a big phone user, but i do use it everyday to use some apps and to stream music. It's really really good. The camera also takes really good pictures. Often, people ask me to use my phone to take group pictures because they say \"wow it came out really clear\". Yes, the phone works overseas! I bought an unlocked phone because I went to Nicaragua. All i had to do was purchase a sim card from there (movistar), which cost about $10USD, and pop it in the phone! Worked perfectly over there for calls and texts!! It's not bulky at all I think it's a perfect size, even with a cover i think it's pretty slim. The bluetooth connectivity is great, i haven't had any problems with it. I definitely recommend it! I would buy it again or for someone else!Only one CON really for me: I wish the battery life lasted longer. If I don't charge it within the day, and start off with 100% in the morning, by about 6 pm i would have about 15% only. I have a car charger so i usually do that and that works out for me.",

I think that was the problem, maybe I should have tested it before performing the update but I decided to test it.First week:-Battery life just 5 hours. Using app as (Strava, Ingress) also WIFI.-GPS inaccurate. If I compare it with my previous Moto E from scale of 10. I would give 10 to my Moto E and 6 to Moto G 2014-At 5th day GPS stopped working.At the end of my first testing week. I decided to make a factory reset.This are my impressions so far.-The battery life have been improved. 8 hours (Strava, Ingress)-GPS improved a little bit. I would give a 7. There is some kind of lag when using GPS app. THIS DID NOT HAPPENED WITH Moto EI hope that the new version of Lollipop could solve many of this issues. I will give my impression as soon as it\u2019s available to Moto G 2nd Gen.Otherwise I will have to perform a hard reset.",

BUT After using it a few days I noticed the notification bar would appear to stop working and buttons wouldn't work. Then I realized the touchscreen was requiring pressing slightly above the actual section of the screen I wanted to press. This was why the notification bar wasn't working, it was expecting a press above the actual physical screen. The problem was it would happen randomly and in any application. Texting would sometimes be completely impossible making the phone pretty unusable.So, I attempted to return it through Motorola and the tech on the chat had a problem entering the IMEI for the return. I called the next day and the same problem and they said it was escalated to a repair escalation team and they would call me back. Now, it is at the end of the week and they told me to call back on Monday. I guess this is too new of a phone with too many bugs and problems with the support/exchange process. I should have avoided the pain. The phone is currently going through the Amazon return process...",

            "comment": "Coming from someone who has strictly owned Google Nexus phones since the Galaxy Nexus was released, I have to say that this phone is quite sluggish and struggles at multitasking.  For example, if I am playing music via say, SoundCloud, Poweramp, or any of the myriad listening apps I have on my phone, and I try to open Google Maps or my GPS tracking exercise app at the same time, there is a 50% chance the music app will hang up and crash.  Same goes for trying to use the camera while listening to music, or listening to podcasts while browsing the web/viewing Facebook.  It's honestly very frustrating when you have to keep going back, reopening apps, and navigating back to where you were because the phone can't multitask properly.  Imagine you are driving and navigating using Google Maps, then you try to play music at the same time, but the phone hangs up for 5 to 10 seconds, stops navigating, then even the launcher resets.  Usable, but a tedious experience.Bluetooth is quite choppy as well, whether I've paired my phone to my car, my bluetooth headset, etc.  All these issues cropped up right off the bat when I purchased this phone three months ago to replace my Nexus 4.  The phone's display and build quality are quite decent though, and I do suppose it is more of a budget option, but if you are interested in a smooth experience beyond just making calls and texting, you might want to settle on a different phone.  (I would give it a 2.5 out of 5.)",

For the price you pay, you get more out of this phone. i have using this phone for a month and my overall experience so far has been great. i use this phone mainly for music and phone calls, so the low processing power does not really matter to me because i did not buy this phone to multi  task or play games.Pros:Great camera quality (8 mega pix). ease of usage . Android Lolipop, feels great in my hand. the stereo  speakers are great for low volume music.Cons:Battery (2070 mAh) could have been better. they could have made those side buttons more sturdier because you can here the rattling sound if you shake it .Although they say gorilla glass is scratch resistance i found a small scratch (not noticeable unless looked very carefully) on the glass. i have no keys , coins or anything in the pocket that i place my phone so i don't know how did that happenoverall, i think this product has the same features of a flag ship device with a low powered processor. so if you do not multitask that much  or play very intensive games, this is a superb phone for you.If this had a better processor, higher ppi and a good Battery, im willing to even pay $500 for this phone because of its design.i know this is not a Motorola's fault but apps won't really install to the Micro SD card, so you only have 5gb to play around with apps. i tried downloading a 3gb game and it won't let me install that on the Micro SD.",

I am sort of 'between' phones right now - my current one is end-of-life-ing, and I don't see anything on the market right now that I want to spend $100's on, so I am waiting for new models and purchased this phone because of the excellent price and great reviews.Unfortunately, I've had it less than 24 hours and have boxed it up for return.  My unit could not maintain a connection with my in-home Wifi signal, which is critical because I live in a cell dead-zone, so no Wifi means no calls, period. There's nothing wrong with my WiFi signal, and we never have connection problems in the house.  I had this phone sitting right next to my LG, and this phone would repeatedly drop the Wifi while the LG didn't even blip.I do think this phone would have been a lot of fun - really customizable, good speakers, nice screen, felt good in the hand - but unfortunately the Wifi issue is a deal-breaker for me. I don't know if it's a lemon, because I don't see this issue in any other reviews - may be a regular issue and people don't notice it because they're aren't as Wifi-dependent as I am.  Regardless, back it goes.",

Everything works fine with Phone except one really weird issue.First the Pros..\u2022 Really nice Display\u2022 Bigger screen size than the previous one\u2022 Speaker sound is really good\u2022 Another big improvement in Camera\u2026 8MP with Flash.. Picture quality also is decent.\u2022 Performance wise also phone is really goodCons..The only issue which I am having is.. The display goes blank (black) randomly like 10/15 times in a day. Then we have to press power button again and unlock the phone (3/4 time) to get it working again. Initially I thought it might be some display settings issue but this one is persisting. It is really painful since that screen gets blank mostly when are getting a call or you are in middle of something important.I ordered a replacement and used in for like 15 days but still the same problem is there. I am not sure if anyone else is having the same issue or is it related to International version only. Everthing else apart for this is really good though \uf04c .",

Everything was working seamlessly, it was fast and I got all the appropriate updates immediately. I was in phone heaven. Then everything just went wrong. For some reason which neither my carrier, myself or a bunch of phone guys that I talked to can figure out, the data plan doesn't work so I don't have internet access unless I'm connected to a wi-fi network. I guess I can live with that for a bit. But then, they phone stopped being able to be charged. The charger it came with is useless. I can get it to charge a little with another charger but I've had it for a week and it has never charged to 100%. The max I got was 50%. Finally, it has become extremely slow, laggy and a pain in the ass to use. My previous $20 phone that I hated is in fact looking better at this point. I am not sure if I got a defective unit but boy do I want my money back. If the phone worked as it did the first day I got it, I would have given it % stars. Unfortuantely it has turned into a lemon too fast.",

My husband and mother both have the LG Nexus phones sold by Google. And I was trying to save money. In the long run, I lost! First, there's absolutely no support or warranty service that I can find. If I'm mistaken and someone can point me in the right direction, please do so. Second, I have to charge the phone multiple times per day. It goes from 100% to 0% some days in less than 3 hours. And yes, I have done the charging as the manufacturer recommends to recalibrate the battery. Third, the phone gets so hot in the open, outside pocket of my purse it burns my hand when I pick it up. I'm afraid it's going to combust in my purse. And lastly, at least what I can think of right now, is that it freezes up constantly. I have to reboot it 2-3 times per day. I'm not a heavy user - phone, checking email, texting. This is just not right. I'm basically going to have to throw it away and spend even more to get a better phone.

The upgrade to Lollipop mostly solved the issue, now the music app only closes when I browse heavy pages.  There is also a few seconds of slow down when I return to the home screen or switch apps after some heavy web browsing.  I'm pretty sure this is a low memory issue since this phone only has 1GB of RAM.  Everything else works great.  Lollipop adds lock screen notifications so I don't need to use a third party app anymore.  There is really not much to complain about for a budget phone, I'm coming from an iPhone 5 because I wanted a larger screen, and I don't find this phone lacking at all.  Only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow downs and auto closing of apps when memory runs low.On a side note, the manual says not to use a sim card adapter with this phone, but I've been using a nano to micro sim adapter with no problems, you just need to get a quality one.  I'm using a Noosy adapter with mine.",

I got my replacement the next day (paid for the express shipping). Seems that Lollipop has some weird bug regarding the location setting being on. The bug causes incorrect readings on the battery or even it drains the battery ridiculously fast. Switching location off solves the problem though. Small thing though, the phone works well. Very snappy phone, the device performs well. Web browsing works quickly, Cellular data speeds peak around 1.5Megabytes/Second (12Mbps) too (3G). The charging cord included charges pretty slowly, though. 6 Hours for full battery status. Beautiful screen. Loud, clear speakers. Cheap buttons. The buttons, they are cheap plastic. Nice camera, for an everyman. Bright flash for the flashlight function. Has the latest android OS. Supports my 32 GB SDHC card. Huge difference between this an my ancient iPhone 4. Very satisfied, loving this phone a lot. Works on MetroPCS $60 Unlimited Data plan.",

I had purchased a cheap chinese (Blu) phone and had to send back for not working so decided to pay-up to a better rated phone. The difference is amazing. The phone is just the right weight, the glass screen is crystal clear and doesn't seem to get printed up with finger prints as bad as the plastic screen. But where this Moto G 2nd really shines is with useablility. From the start the phone is intuitive and guides you along to get up and running. It comes with CLEAR, CONCISE, EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND!! ACTUALLY GOOD ENGLISH fast start menu. What does it say to a companies support if they can't even take the time to get an adequate correct english user manual! Don't waste money on cheap chinese. Long story short this phone is nice, easy to use, quality construction, latest software (lolipop 5.0) that my kids were impressed with. I would buy this again in a heartbeat, but I won't have to for a long time, unless they start having hologram screens or some such tech improvement.",

With the stock android experience the phone performs exeptionaly well optimizing performance with a quad core qualocom snapdrogon 400 quad core processor which is extremely rare to find on a phone this low of a price. The only downside is the camera because the exposure is completely off because it tries to expose the light itself. Its ok if you're a person is that doesn't take too many picture. If you are a heavy app user you only have 8 gigs of storage but you have an expandable sd card slot which I would recommend buying with this product for only 16 dollars extra which is an amazing deal because other phones it costs around 50 dollars for an adirional 8 gb. The display on this phone is amazing for only being a 720p display but text and images are amazingly sharp for its resolution. This is one of the best phone on the market if you aren't looking for an on contract phone with a pure android experience and amazing speed.

            "comment": "This is by far the best value for money phone on the market.  The sound quality is excellent, battery life is great and camera takes superb pictures.That said, I'm dinging it by one star just because I find it a little sluggish.  I upgraded from a Galaxy S2, which while old and lacking in many other departments, was at least fairly responsive to my clicks.  The Moto can sometimes take a second or two to load stuff from the home page, or respond to other touches, which is not a train smash, but can sometimes be annoying.Also, be aware that the 8GB advertised here is not actually 8GB: the operating system and pre-installed software takes up over half the space, so in practice you only have 3.5GB free.  You definitely need to get an SD card for this phone.I still think it's a worthwhile buy; just be mentally prepared for somewhat sluggish performance, and when you find yourself getting frustrated,  remind yourself the price you paid for it, and ask yourself if you would be prepared to pay an extra $300 for a snappier response time.",

Bluetooth range is great as compared to galaxy s3. gps gets a good and fast lock on the location. there is some useful stuff pre-installed by Motorola and some not so useful stuff, it denends on how you use the phone to decide whats useful for you.",

No doubt they are great to use, but I don't see the value in the higher end phones being same cost as my rent or more; and I don't have need to run a million apps and let the phone manage my life.I had doubts on the Moto G at first, but it's better than I expected.I wanted a good smart phone for the basics.. 1)phone, 2) messaging, 3) whatsapp, 4) quick checks on tripadvisor or google when I'm out and about, 5) spur of the moment photos, when cooking or cycling the countryside, etc. 6) video calls on Skype or Viber with friends/family.The phone does all i want just as good as any top end phone.It's is fast, meaning no annoying delay in running apps; the call quality is good; audio & video is good, photos are actually great as a point n shoot... The camera startup could be a tad bit faster but as it is, it's good enough. The price point on this phone is great. Definitely get value for money.",

Playing games will drain the battery quickly, but if you don't play games on it for long, and use it mostly for other things like Google maps, calendar, social media sites, web browsing, etc. You'll probably make it to the end of the day with at least 20% battery left. I have used this phone for several hours straight a few times, (web browsing, facebook, twitter, a few games etc) and still had more than 30% battery left when I was done.There is a lot of space on this phone, especially if you use an SD card and use an app to move apps to the SD card. I have most of my apps on the SD card, and some of them on the internal storage of the phone (some of them can't be moved to the SD card), and I still have 1.6 Gb of internal storage available. I have never had any major issues with games not playing smoothly on this phone. Also, the screen resolution is excellent.",

It wasn't an easy task: it had to be easy to use, under $200, with a nice keyboard and large font size. We decided that the Moto G was the best option and bought them.After a bit more than half a year of use, mom and mom-in-law are both in love with their phones. Mom-in-law has embraced the Google knows your every move thing, adding every little thing to the calendar to receive alerts and estimates on the traffic, while mom thinks skynet will come if she continues to feed that information and has deactivated all those things. They both carry the phones in their purses and they have endured quite gracefully the crashing against various things over a long period of time. The battery also lasts for quite a while, which is an A+ for them.So, tl/dr: if you're looking for a smartphone and are in a budget, give this phone a chance.",

The first phone had something wrong with the sim slot and the 2nd broke after upgrading to lollipop. After scouring the forums for possible fixes I decided to give moto support a try. The first CSR spoke very limited English so I tried the chat option. Astrid had no clue other then to ask if I've rebooted the phone and that was the extent of her support. After putting me on chat hold for 20 minutes I assume to ask someone what she should say next, she returned with this offer...\" We will put a hold on your CC FOR 100.00 dollars and we will send you a used phone, when we get your new phone we will release the hold\" I wrote back to her that she must get called a lot of colorful names. Amazon has been terrific about taking the phones back, thanks. I'm wondering if I was sent 2 phones that had been returned and repackged by Motorola?",

The phone is well-designed and fits well in your hand (I have smaller hands, and this phone works well), the screen and video qualities are impressive for this price range, and the battery has notable longevity (I get nearly 2 days on a full charge). I am just as happy with this phone as I would be with spending hundreds more on other models. Note that you can buy different colored backs for the phone, but it comes with a standard black back, which works great. The phone is only 3G, but the differences between 3G and 4G seem to be somewhat murky across companies. Despite that, I am able to watch videos from the internet with no issues (although I typically have the phone connected to wifi anyway). For the vast majority of smart phone users, this phone should give you everything you want and then some. Having access to hundreds of apps via Google makes this phone's application near limitless. I would recommend the Moto G.",

The best part its factory unlocked  no more being taken hostage by Carrier Contracts and it works great with AT&T with all the benefits.If i choose i can go to a number of Carriers and slip in a Sim card and i'm up and running in minutes :) AND its guaranteed for the next update from KitKat to Lollipop when it's  available in my area. AND it has a  32GB memory card slot so don't let the 8GB worry you because 32GB gives you plenty of space.  Its a Nice phone for under $200.00 which brings me to phones costing $400 to $700 with basically the same functions. If your looking for a nice phone  get the Moto G 2 factory unlocked.",

The front fire speakers are a nice touch not anything that'll knock your socks off but sound fine. Battery life will easily last the day if not over used, either way it needs to be on the charger at the end of the day. The camera is good the few pictures I've taken look fine. WiFi has decent range I can use anywhere in the house. I was waiting for the second gen to get SD storage cause 8 gigs wasn't going to cut it I'm using a 32 gig card. The SD addition, bigger screen along with the Lollipop software upgrade was the deal maker for me. Bottom line for a very affordable basic phone with decent specs and excellent build quality this one is hard to beat..PS  Cell coverage in my rural area has always been iffy at best so I've been using the phone for WiFi calling (no sim) and it works very well.Edit: 1-13-15 After a couple of weeks of ownership the phone has for the most part met my expectations only draw backs are still no Lollipop update I guess Google is working out the bugs and battery life even with moderate use it drops off fast. I have Lollipop on my 2013 Nexus 7 and it has given me no problems, I like it and would like to see it on my phone. Still believe for the price this mid level phone was a bargain",

The battery with a day being on WiFi and moderate daily use, shows 50% left by the end of the day. I don't have Internet plan with my T-Mobile. For people complaining about the battery life I would suggest uninstalling all apps they have installed and adding them back one at a time and monitoring battery usage. Sometime a single app can drain the battery in a few hours even with that app being stopped using the task manager. It happened to me with my android tablet and the culprit was Sygic, a free GPS app. I moved back to Android from a Windows phone, which was a complete disaster.",

I'm in.Amazon shipping was fast....the Moto G 2nd Gen arrived sooner than expected.For some reason it didn't come with a sim card.No problem as I took it to the TMobile kiosk at the mall and they installed the sim card (free) with my TMobile minutes in no time and my Moto G 2nd Gen was good to go.Having been used to my dumbphones small screen I was taken aback by the vividly rich colors and sharpness of the  5 inch display on this puppy.The Moto G feels well built and soiid and I can hold it very comfortably.  And I can put in my jeans pocket and almost forget it's there.I liked the 8 pixel camera after giving it a good work out and was pretty well pleased with the results.I had read a lot of good things regarding the free Google Camera app so decided to download it.I must say it turned what I would call a very nice camera into an even better one. I found the Google Camera app does better in low light than the stock camera and I really like the features including \"camera blur\".As far as battery life: I have yet to get at least 24 hours with usually about 15% left.  This after my routine, surfing, ebook reading, light camera use, email, gaming (Scrabble, Classic Word...not heavy duty gaming) youtube, IHeart and TuneIn radio, wifi calling and texting and vpn use at public wifi hotspots.  Mostly I keep screen brightness at or below 50% and use battery saver.I could go on and on about this smartphone but all I can say is that I like it very much and am glad I now continue with the my less than 10 bucks a month personal commuicatioon using TMobile prepaid minutes and wifi phone (Text Me app) in one, user friendly , efficient and sexy device with all the bells and whistles I need and then some at a bargain of a price.The $179  Moto G 2nd gen is one heck of a deal.One other thing: don't waste your money on screen protectors.The Moto G 2nd gen comes with gorilla glass which takes an awful lot of effort to scratch.  Check out the gorilla glass tests on youtube.UPDATE: 5/11/15  After several months as an owner of this phone I am quite pleased.Also didn't realize just how much I enjoy listening to the FM radio app that is included with the phone.  Very good reception.",

I watch TV on it and it runswith no issues (TWC app). Connects to the interent quickly and I can get my max speed from my ISP on it (50/5). If you want to play games then moto x ismuch better (own one as well). Screen size is just right, although after trying a 5.5 inch phone (Note 4, returned it, T-mobile refused to unlock it), Iappreciate the bigger screen size. Battery life is excellent, I can go two days without charging after making sure no unwanted apps are running in thebackground. It has a battery saver function that kicks in when the battery is low (20%) and it gives me about five, if not more, extra hours. You cannot beatthe price and performance ratio on this phone. Cameras are excellent for my needs. It takes pics quickly with no lag. I added a SanDisk Extreme SDcard, 32GB and it recognized it with no problems.Cons:I find that a faster cpu and more RAM will be much more helpful. Also, Android Lollipop is not yet out for it, although Motorola say it is. It is out and installedOTA on the moto x, not this phone.An added bonus is if you lose the phone you wont get a $1000 shock like if you own one of them much more expensive phones. Overall, I am satisfiedwith the phone and recommend it for the budget-oriented, basic use buyer.",

I get a day and a half of life with mild usage, and a solid day with heavy usage. I am running Android 4.4 with ART. I wouldn't recommend that you update to 5.0 just yet because the graphical interface of 5.0 will slow you down, and 4.4 runs smooth as a dream. The 4.4 Android is a vanilla build and that is a good thing and a bad thing. It is good because it uses little resources to operate and updates are released quickly, and it is a bad thing because it is lacking some of the fancy built in features like a Samsung build has. The camera is good for photos, but the video auto-focus gets a little messed up sometimes. I am using a 64GB card, even though the specs say it only supports 32GB. A 64GB card will work just fine as long as you format the card in the phone, or format the card as FAT32 before inserting it. I have this phone in a protective case, and have dropped it many times without any damage visible. The speakers are above average for music, but have a little too strong base tone (low frequency) when talking on the phone. The screen is very nice, at full brightness it can be read in direct sunlight, is 10-finger touch capacitive, and does not have a scratch on it thanks to the Gorilla Glass. Buttons work well, 3.5mm jack for stereo output,  and mini-USB for charging.",

This thing is not worth the money and is garbage quality at best.  Camera is mediocre at best.Edit: The main concerns is it's SUPER slow; randomly dials people.  Imagine waiting a minute for an app to load; there's no space and the system doesn't respond at all.  The wifi breaks; the bluetooth disconnects and the internet randomly never works.  You'll have no bars of battery life.If all the fake positive reviews aren't enough; the phone is flat out bad; either invest in a good phone or look elsewhere.  This phone is seemingly nice but is incredibly weak (and the reviews are lies as you can get faster processors, ram and storage capacity else where).  The Android version is terrible as it has memory leak issues.Final Note: this thing also randomly crashes everything and then your apps will all disappear off of the main screen and have to be re-added back to the main screens.",

            "comment": "I've been trying to think about how to describe this phone in a way that might be really helpful, without repeating what others have said.Bottom line is, this phone is a 5 star phone for the right user, but you need to know you are the right user. If you heavily do browsing on your phone, with a lot of multitasking, you should probably invest in something a little faster and better equipped for those tasks, it will be worth it. Try the Nexus 5 in that cass, or the MOTO X (both fantastic phones).However if you are like me, and don't heavily use a phone for multitasking, you'll find this app is quite fast for running a couple of apps at a time. You'll find the screen is big enough for use, and small and thin enough to go in a man's pocket. Women generally have smaller pockets and this probably won't fit. It's not as thin as the NEXUS 5 or some other phones, but it's not too bad. That could be a deal breaker for some though.The price and value is what really sales this phone. It's reliable and functional for sure, and at this price it's hard to justify a more expensive phone in my opinion because I think the performance gain in other phones is not worth it for most of the apps and tasks that the average person uses on their phone.I hope this helped. Please post a question if you have one! I'd love to answer it.",

It works perfect.UPDATE: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------after using 3 month the screen was broken accidentally.I don't want to repair it anyway.So I buy a new iPhone 6.,but for the price as a backup phone, I think it's OK.but if you want a better experience .don't buy this.1. After using it for a while. install some apps ,the phone becomes laggy. I guess that's the problem of all the cheap android phone.2. 720p screen for a 5 inch phone is a disaster. you can see the pixel dot on the phone.3. The power button and volume adjustment button is so loose.when I hold it it's start to making noise.4. the phone gets dirty after using it for a while.full of your fingerprint.5. camera is so..so bad .that's the problem of all motorola android phone.if you using camera very often .don't' buy this.6. if you update the system to the android 5.0. the system still buggy at the current stage.So don't update.",

I am not a heavy user at all. I take photos and surf the web and use only a couple of apps (Instagram,Feedly, YouTube, etc). All of which it handles without problems. Only two issues I have is: 1. Sometimes the keyboard will not load in chrome. Not sure if that is a chrome or phone problem. 2. The menu can also be slow to load at times (Android 4.4).But for the price, and to know that I am no paying the high service price for Verizon, the phone is great.As for the camera it is good enough for me. All I use it for is to take some photos of my family, for which it is good enough. The photos are similar is quality of the Samsung SIII which I came from. The Moto G also has better call quality then the SIII.Sure,It does not have 4G service, but 3G is plenty good enough for loading Youtube videos and surfing the web.So, if you want to get on a US GSM prepaid carrier, this phone will get the job done.",

The contracts moved over from my old phone do not display when I click on contacts...I get a bunch of emails and the T-Mobile store was not able to figure it out, neither was I.  The battery was almost dead after the first day of use.  I have to constantly keep charging over and over, and the phone heats up as well as, the outlet plug and its scary!  It does not give you the option to select only \"certain parts\" of a text message to delete, instead you have to delete the \"entire\" conversation....my android had that option.  The sound quality when I receive calls could be better.ON A POSITIVE NOTE:  The device is excellent  for photos and videos, as long as you plan to plug it and recharge frequently.  The design is quite nice and light.Overall, I a give it a 2 out of 5 as far as my needs go.",

This phone runs stock android 4.4.4 and upgradble to 5.0 lollipop. The 5\" 720p HD display is actually very nice and clear, compared to the previous model this phones display is A LOT better.  Great processor speed. A 1.2GHz Quad-core on stock android will make the phone so responsive. The camera is wonderful!  Its a 8MP camera which is quite superior. Honestly,  looked just as good as a Samsung Galaxy camera. There are two giant speakers on the bottom and top of the screen with great quality sound. This phone plays games very well,  even hardcore games like MC5, Madden Mobile,  fifa 15. The designand feel of the phone is great. Replacable back cover of different colors. the down side is it only has 3G but on the AT&T network 3G is decently fast not slow at all.",

After using Motorola Migrate to transfer my apps and files to my new phone I transferred my SIM card, inserted the 32GB mem card and was up and running.  I also upgraded my Android Op Sys to Lollipop.  Half of my apps didn't transfer correctly and many others didn't seem to load properly.  They'd try to install but couldn't complete installation.  I did a reset on the phone which left Lollipop on the phone but removed all user files.  This time I allowed the phone to reload from Google backup and 90% of my apps were loaded automatically and seem to be working well.  Any new apps I have tried now load well and completely.  I initially thought Lollipop was the problem but it now seem more likely it was a conflict between Migrate and Google backup.  Whatever, the new phone works well and the larger screen is great.  Battery life seems a little better than my Moto G.",

An iPhone it is not, but it IS sufficient for my needs. It runs well, but needs to be restarted every couple of weeks to freshen its performance. When playing music through bluetooth to my car stereo, the volume is much lower than that provided by my wife's iPhone; reason unknown. The screen is large and bright, and the buttons are easy to use. The battery life is good. I charge it every night and so far have not gone below 54% battery after a full day of use. Best thing for me is I own it outright, it is unlocked, and I can use any provider I wish - and not be locked into contracts. Oh -- it's affordable!",

To go to the 4x zoom that the camera offers (digital) it takes many attempts. The screen is not very responsive and at times the same finger gesture to zoom in leads to a zoom out. Coming from iPhone 5 it is one feature I am still coming to terms with. Rest everything is brilliant and I am happy to be using this phone. I use it with a 16 GB SD card.

Frankly I'm tired of investing several hundred dollars in a phone every few years so I decided to go budget this time. The build quality is nice, and it feels like a quality phone. One gripe: I hate having to removed the back to insert an SD card. Call quality is generally very good, the camera is okay but quirky, sometimes locking itself into portrait orientation. The UI is a bit sluggish sometimes once you have a half dozen apps on it and can be quirky opening apps on it's own. All in all It performs like a $150 phone so I really can't gripe; it works pretty well for a fraction of the price of a flagship. While I'll probably tire of it much sooner than I would a Nexus or a Samsung at this price I can replace it when that time comes.",

I bought generic chargers online which supplies 2A current and it charges in slightly more than an hour. note: buy those that says it will give as much current as your device needs.

For the price, I would not go further to get any other more expensive phone, this one has all I need and makes it work very fast. The only one thing I could say is not perfect goes to the manufacturer, not the phone itself, as Motorola does not offer a software to manage your phone and or sync it with your computer. As a result, it does not come with connectivity cable. It does not come with hands free/headphones either, which would be nice. I guess that selling this excellent phone at this low price does not allow to ship it with any headset.",

I am hopeful that this phone will get me through at least until my current 2 year contract with ATT runs out (6 months after the complete failure of my contract phone). I didn't mind that it only has 3G where as my old phone had 4G because I mostly use my phone at home over the wifi.

This was a purchase from Amazon so I'm hoping if this does happen they will be honorable and take care of it. My only question is why are they having so many problems with these phones? These are suppose to be NEW phones from Motorola. I will update this review as I see what happens with the phone. If anyone has any questions feel free to send them.

I've been using it since last December. Really good camera. With a 32GB micro-SD card, I do not have to worry about storage. Feels nice and sturdy. The curved back helps it fit nicely in the palm. Only drawback (if it matters, it doesn't to me) is that it is not 4G compatible. I am usually at home or at work and connect through WiFi, so it is not a big deal to me. And 3G/HSPA speeds are sufficient for me at other times. Being an Android phone, integration with Google services is very smooth. The battery holds charge for a day of average use, but I do need to charge it every night. But for the price you can't go wrong with it.",

If it were not for the poor quality control that got me a phone that didn't function initially, I'd rate this 4-5 stars.  For the money, I think the feature set and quality of the working phone is really excellent.  Screen looks fine, phone feels smooth and snappy for the things I've done so far -- email, web browsing, facebook, Zynga games, etc.  Haven't tried graphics intensive games, but seems good to me at this point.Original review, and reason I don't rate it more highlyGot one for Christmas, and had high hopes for it.  But it was dead out of the box.  It was stuck in a \"boot loop\", showing the Motorola logo/powered by android screen followed by a black screen repeatedly.  A call to Motorola customer service gave a long wait followed by trying a few things followed by a disconnect.  I wasn't willing to spend all day on the phone with them, so I returned it for a new one.  May revise this review upwards if the new one works, but doesn't speak well for their quality control.And yes, I tried the various solutions for boot looping on the internet.  Factory reset, recovery, etc.  Shouldn't happen to a brand new device.",

Everything about this phone, (components, features, specs, build quality, feel, ease of use) is excellent for the price.  Shipping was fast and free with Amazon Prime, overall this was one of my best online shopping experiences, ever.

I'm far from a power user so the battery easily lasts about 2-3 days every time I charge it.

When scrolling thru websites this phone stuttered a bit and sometimes it selected things on its own without me pressing on them. Even though it has a quad core processor it sometimes lagged a bit, specially when typing, this was a deal breaker for me. Needless to say I ended up returning the phone. For the same price I ended up buying a LG Nexus 5 from eBay and it is such a big difference. Its a good started phone but not for me.",

So if you are changing from a phone with a \"regular\" sd, like my old htc, heads up!  ATT was ready for me though and switched my data in minutes at no charge.  I also imported all of my contacts to my gmail account (online) so that they would be easily connected to my new phone.  Battery life is about as expected.  I don't play games or music, just emailing, texting, FB, so lasts all day for me with a bit left over.  Photos were much better than the HTC insight.",

When my parents took the phones to be activated, the T-Mobile representative told them that the phones were locked and registered for the AT&T network. I tried to unlock the phones  on AT&T's website using the IMEI numbers, but neither phone showed as being registered to AT&T. My parents took the phones to an AT&T store, but the AT&T representatives were not able to unlock the phones either. These phones would have been great for my parents, but now they have to be returned.",

We got the AT&T sim from them, so it is on the AT&T network, as the T-Mobile signal is non-existent in our home.  The unit is light and the screen while not the highest resolution is very, very crisp - she really likes it.  A great benefit of buying this unlocked phones is that you can get updates much more quickly than from a cell carrier.  For example, the Android 5 (lollipop) update was just released and we updated the phone already.  And while it does have some pre-installed apps, its nothing like all the junk installed on the phones from a carrier that you can not install.",

As of now, it is still Android 5.0.1(hoping the upgrade can fix those software issues).",

True, the screen is 1280x720 instead of 1980x1080 but at it's size, it's indistinguishable to my old eyeballs (and I'm something of a home theater videophile). If you live and die by the smart phone, this may not be enough horsepower for you, but if you barely want a smart phone, this is more than good enough.",

The 4g model and this one will accept memory cards, but they DO NOT like the fastest available. A very reasonably priced model that works (under $14) is the \"Samsung 32GB Class 6 Micro SDHC up to 24MB/s with Adapter (MB-MS32DA/AM)\" available on Amazon.I know people are wondering, why did you buy so many? Simple enough, I have 6 lines on my account. Two daughters, a sister, a wife, myself, and a friend. The global model has traveled to Ukraine and back a couple of times, no problems in Turkey, Ukraine, Germany, or any place we've tried it. It also works perfectly fine in the US, however coverage will be reduced (primarily with T-Mobile). I might add that the US models seem to roam internationally just fine as well, but again, your coverage may be reduced.In all fairness, one of the first generation died within the first two months, Motorola shipped a replacement via next day with a pre-paid return for the broken phone! Another died after 18 months, so out of warranty and a second generation purchased to replace it.BTW, the 4g LTE model is my phone, and it replaced a Nexus 4. I couldn't be happier with a sub $200 phone. It compares favorably with most $500 to $600 phones.Bottom line, for a no contract phone, you can't go wrong with this one. You get your money's worth!",

I ran across 3 devices that met my criterion. - Moto G - Sony Xperia T2 Ultra - Huawei Ascend Mate2These were all $300 or below. I was a little skeptical about the size of the Sony and Huawei as they were listed at 6.0 and 6.1 inches for screen size. After looking at the Xperia, I did not like the size of the device as well as the low pixel per inch count which made the icons look rather blurry.As far as processing goes, the Sony was rated a little faster but so far I have not noticed any lag with things that I've been doing. (Email, Clash of Clans, chatting, texting, etc).With normal usage, my battery has lasted me all day. Generally, I have had between 15% and 30% of battery life left at the end of night. My day generally runs from 6am - 10:30pm. My Nexus 5 generally did not make it past 5 or 6 in the evening.Bluetooth connection to my car worked flawlessly right off the bat. Adding my car as a trusted device allows the phone to remain unlocked while I am driving. This make voice commands a lot easier.Pictures are very clear even in lower light situations. However, the camera app doesn't have an actual button to press like other phones. So explaining it to someone else using your phone could get a little annoying.",

The only beef I've had with the new G is the slight delay/stutter that I have occasionally when exiting an app and returning to the home screen; not every time (but fairly frequently), I will have a blank home screen with no dock or icons - I attribute this to the 1GB of RAM in the G vs. the 2GB of RAM I had in the Nexus 4. Let me repeat - this is only a MINOR hiccup (it goes right on after a second or so every time) in an otherwise perfect BUDGET phone. Everything else about this phone is an improvement over the Nexus 4, in my opinion.",

I'm using my phone in South America and can't use the warranty outside the US.

If I knew that I could lose all the data of my microsdhc card, I wouldn't have bought this phone at all. I trust Amazon reviews and I didn't read anything concerning this topic, so I wanted to make sure that everyone knows about this problem. The worst thing is that I can't trust using a new microsdhc card because I fear the same thing will happen again.

I'm completely unsatisfied with it and Motorola hasn't given me any answers. So please BEWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.",

It's speedy, responsive, feels solid, what more can I say ...The three dead spots I mentioned are now only one, only noticeable on a white background. Until now I've only trusted Samsung, but this Moto G has really really impressed me.",

When The ite arrived it it came in a small non original box with no wrapping around The phone or anything. Got The phone out and The used charger, The phone looked BRAND NEW! It didnt have a single scratch,ding,dent on it. The phone came with 0% battery life no biggie charged it up for 10 mins turned it on did my set up and as soon as i got to The main screen i got The lollipop update! Anyways highly recomend JP mobiles if you wanns save $40+ on moto g 2gen. (Everthing on the phone works flawless). Highly recomend iflash tempered glass.",

It handles it own dispite it being laggy when you really start pushing things on the multi tasking side of things. Camera quality isnt bad at all, phone signal and call quality are good but I wouldn't say they are the best. Screen brightnes and viewing angles are good, it has a super bright flash.The biggest let down to me is the battery life, I can get max 7-9 hours of use out of the phone before I'm running for a charger. With the lack of memory and longer battery life I only gave it a 4/5. But for the price I would definitely recommend it.",

It can take 20 seconds to switch from app to app or open apps due to 5.0.2's memory management bugs.I bought a used nexus 5 and I'm MUCH happier.Nexus IS android. Everyone else is just a middleman vendor that will end up frustrating you with non-support for your phone (be it security patches or just OS upgrades).Do yourself a favor and get a used nexus 5.",

Immediately i have ordered this phone and got through Amazon Prime. The Phone looks \"Awesome\" and no more issues like My old mobile and the main important thing - The Battery life is Excellent.

The Motorola Moto G had some rave reviews by reviewers on many sites. It is quite inexpensive and has a 'largish' screen. It has been everything I have hoped for. I realize that it is not a powerhouse, but it runs light years ahead of my Nexus 7 first gen tablet. (Not to criticize the Nexus 7 because it is great, too). If you are looking for a smartphone that you won't have to take out a second mortgage for, this is the one. Android has already updated mine to Lollipop.",

It has a beautiful screen and fairly decent speakers.  However, if you are an Android power user like I am, then the 1 GB of RAM is really insufficient.  The OS is constantly killing apps like Chrome in the background in order to make room for other applications.  This was really annoying to me, especially since I'm used to being able to switch between apps with ease without them having to 'restart.'",

So far I like this better than the Nexus 4. Its responsive and that battery life. Its ENDLESS. I have gotten almost 20 hours out of one single charge. That alone makes this phone a superb buy.

I've had phones with much better specs than this struggle to run Android without chugging, but Motorola somehow manages it great.Stock android is a really good plus for the Moto G, and the phone handles and feels like a upper-mid-range phone rather than a $180 phone. If you're a little tight on money, get the Moto G, and if you want a little more premium-ness or neat features, get the Moto X.",

I'm from Venezuela and the phone works perfectly with Digitel and Movistar, it gets 3G with both. I have not tested with Movilnet. Although it should work the same. In conclusion, it is the best choice for your mid-high range. I highly recommend it.",

But for 200 I can justify that :) I can really recommendMoto G 2nd gen to somebody in need to upgrade, but not wanting to spend $$$.",

As I said the best phone for the buck!!",

Even better with the new Lollipop Update! Easily one of if not the best budget (under $200) android phones. Got an ever better price on it before Christmas.",

Overall it works great, virtually exactly the same as my first generation Nexus tablet.Pros: affordable! No contract. No bloatware. Great basic design. Good screen. Motorola Migrate app.Cons: a few glitchy things so far. Non-removable battery. Poor WiFi reception. No LTE radio, a big con if you're a heavy data user.",

It seems like the battery life isn't very good, not bad but not great either. That could change after the phone gets broken in. Good value nice call quality and the ringer is very loud. That help a lot when you have old ears like me. If you are looking for a personal smartphone the Moto G 2nd gen. is a good option.Update, I've had the phone for a couple of days and I upped the rating to five stars. The problem with the battery wasn't the phone's fault. It was all the google stuff. I went to the app's in settings and disabled most of the google bloatware. That cured the problem. I have 36 hours on my first charge and there is still 32 per cent left on the battery. This phone is a keeper.",

The internal memory is 8gb, so I installed a 32 gb sd card.  This is plenty space for some apps and tons of music and pictures.  It is an unlocked phone so it is not loaded down with all kinds of apps, just a simple and easy to navigate android.  The screen is made of gorilla glass and the back is a substantial plastic.  The back of the phone is curved so it feels good in the hand.  I ordered this for my daughter and I think this is a great phone for her.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the front and back cameras.  They are good, but not as good as my Samsung S5.  However, they are good enough to get the job done, especially in good light.  Do not let this deter you from purchasing the Moto G.  I have had positive experiences with Motorola products in the past and I am very pleased with this purchase.  If you're looking for a really nice unlocked phone at a reasonable price, this one is a keeper.",

Screen quality is crisp and clear, and its stripped-down version of the OS (mine runs Lollipop) makes for a smooth and quick multitasking experience. Battery life is great - I can almost get away with charging mine every other night. I've found call quality to be great as well (on AT&T in the city).My only qualm is the speakers - music sounds a little tinny and sometimes I find myself wishing I could push up the volume a notch or two more on speakerphone. But it's a minor thing, and for this price it doesn't warrant lowering the rating.Those accustomed to Galaxy's or iPhones may also find the build a bit bulky. I find it fits great in my hand, and since it's not a $600 phone, I don't bother with a bulky case anyway, so it really evens out :)All in all, it's $175 you won't regret spending.",

The previous version is quick, rarely crashes down, works well with modifications and advanced software additions and customizations. This one does all of this plus it is a tad brighter, easier to read and work-on screen,  performs as well if not better than most bigger name models that cost twice as much and more. Highly recommended .",

So far it is working great for all of my intended uses.  It is very usable in sunshine which is also important to me given the intended uses.",

Don't be put off by the lack of LTE, its still very fast.  On T-Mobile in Milwaukee my daughter's moto g gets up to 10 megabits download and that aint bad 'This is a great phone for a kid and actually I wouldn't mind it and I have a moto x 2nd gen.Even in a slower area it still averages 5mbps downloads and that is plenty fast for streaming, email games and web pages.",

This phone has the same hardware specs as the iphone 5c, which was my previous phone, nevertheless, iphone 5c was miles faster and more responsive. This shows you should not compare hardware-to-harware when the OS is so different",

Texting is convenient and all options are great. I like to have the option top turn data off and it has that too. Very happy with this purchase. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but hey, it was free so cant complain much about that.",

It also looks good, camera is nice, screen size is perfect. Before this I was using Samsung phone, hence sometimes I face issue to operate few functions however it's not a big deal. Overall big thumps-up. Happy with my decision to buy it.",

ES File Explorer is a must to increase the functionality. Cheers!",

Could use one hand to do any task on the phone and its pretty light to hold. Highly recommend it.",

My phone will often go five days on a single charge.",

If you are a power phone user, I would not recommend it. 8gb of onboard and 1 gb of memory quickly goes if you are a power user and you will quickly find your self removing apps to install another etc. I highly HIGHLY recommend buying a portable battery charger, even moderate usage will kill your battery quickly.",
